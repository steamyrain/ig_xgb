ok do not know much about this computer stuff was lucky to even get on to this homepage well just got disconnected and think tension level just went up few notches felling really sick already and went this day to end was planning to go work out tonight but it is too late sti will have math and history work left to do really hate math cant understand anything that is being said it really makes me feel like an idiot look at friends here and they all understand everything that is being said wish math class in high school had taught me more guess tomorrow wi will get up to go run ok just hit another wrong button now really feel worthless going to have so much trouble this semester when am going to get to the classes that really want it is looking like going to graduate college in another twenty years as long as do best then guess everything wi will work out miss family and friends back in ohio wish that could go back sometimes if there was anything to go back to do not think that they really care that so far away it is like think to myself that things might be so much better there like if went back then life would all make since think that would be confused anywhere go well typing is starting to slow down now hands are getting tired god should have taking typing class in high school sweet mate is watching late night and it is starting to get on nerves it is so loud please let twenty minutes be up need to get act together if do not then wi will just be wasting parents money maybe should give parents call but think that wi will wait for them to call me need to prepare for school need to try to socialize more if could manage more time maybe should be an actor and work as waiter in new york in the mean time but there go again with fantasies probably stuck with boring life like most people well twenty minutes is up hope that slow typing has ruined this survey 
right now feel somewhat relaxed after having seen one of the most gory movies of all-time the title of the movie is event horizon in which ship is taken over by evil spirits which have been taken onboard through dimension warp brain feels completely clouded over because do not really want to start school also want to bet on football pretty badly this past weekend lost pretty nice piece of change while none of teams covered the spread hope to do much better this weekend but it has me worried toe also seems to be giving me trouble because it got infected about one year ago but it never seems to get all the way healed maybe there is chance that it wi will give me problems for the rest of life pretty tired right now since it is in the morning feel had productive day though because went to class today and got meaningful information from them especially in this class usually have no sort of interest in scientific things like the brain but the lecture seemed really interesting liked the explanations that were given from several things in everyday life it has also just hit me that mr pennebaker said he was from midland which is also hometown think its pretty good place you just have to have little imagination thats all thinking that since ran so much this evening back might actually be sore because of it hell dont know though could use nice woman in life right now but extremely picky unless been boozing it little it is cold somewhat in room right now and there are many things that must take of before tomorrow need to do some laundry and do some reading for class get extremely irritated when things do not operate smoothly wish knew more about computers so that could take care of email problem nice cheeseburger would be excellent right now but dont really want one do to the fact that trying to lose few lbs debating whether or not to turn the tv on and watch movie or just go straight to bed last night almost got in fight with one of pledge brothers and to tell you the truth think the guy knows could have ki willed him because he is not crazy enough to take me really not in position  do some work for good cause need damn job so can get some money to pay off some debts and be in good standing with parents one thing noticed recently is that everyone talks bad about people behind their backs mean sat down and talked bad about probably everyone know people pick out one persons weakness or what they consider to be weakness and bash them pretty good when they arent around know people say stuff about me when back is turned but hey so did i figure its nothing to think about to seriously unless someone is spreading lies that is bullshit been writing now for minutes ill stop is there any that could

write this paper sti will fi willed with the stress but know gets much worse been hired for job and sti will pondering if it is possible to handle both job and school guess you can call it greed about money but need it to stay here also thinking that this to easy college is supposed to be hard and yet hardest class is microeconomics with all this stress sti will have the one thought in head what if was not born? would it be less stressful? this is not suicide letter but the thought of me not being born always enters mind is life nothing but work and school or is it much more do not know guess always thinking about the negative aspects of life the world is not like peaches and cream tonight is busy night to do laundry and do some reading guess psyching myself out and yet alone in city that is surrounded by burden do not know what the point of writing this guess need the grade but even then wish why can not be truly happy about life to think that some where around the world somebody is happy and it makes me sick to think about that life is not fun and games it is weary journey that must be gone through but cant rest feet until done and gone 
feeling little stress coming on now because think about everything to do but have yet to start it sometimes cant resist going out with friends and that is really bad because then do not have time to study do not know what else feeling right now just sitting in front of computer in the pcl and typing along even though the paper doesnt not need correct spelling and stuff sti will go back and correct iti guess cause its habit right now observing people as they walk by really enjoy this assignment because it helps me to put all thoughts and feelings on paper instead of holding them in as what normally do generally do not like to tell people feelings inside guess cause very paranoid and do not trust others with personal secrets even if they were really close friends of mine cant wait until laterp when go practice throwing of footballs really excited about intramural football most of the people on team are really nice just little scared about the real games b/c afraid that the guys on the other coed teams wi will run into me and hurt me was really sore this morning after woke up b/c of football practice yesterday morning football practice was pretty fun enjoy going through all the dri wills and practices at first was not too sure about playing football but when one of friends asked me to join her team was like sure our team makeup is kinda funny we have all upperclassmen guys and mainly freshman girls just thought that was kinda interesting well looking at the clock and it seems like five more minutes of writing time right after do this assignment going to go study on the fourth floor really do not want to be left behind in classes already am and thats not good way to start off college years in high school studied constantly and now rarely get to study b/c there is so much stuff going on and usually give in to friends when they want to go do something think time really does fly by before know it its time to go to sleep again wish had nothing to worry about always wondered what life would be like if was rich it would be much more relaxing think well its already been twenty minutes and would write longer but really have got to go studying cant wait until get to write paper because lot to say about college experience so far 
today is monday and this has been really shitty day this is th time to turn in this assignment right now at boyfriends house b/c computer was as getting interrupted by the phone ringing did not know how to turn off the call waiting so every time that was going to turn in the assignment the phone would ring and would have to start over well lets see from midland and come from family of there are boys and girls there names are carla ian tony tiname and then there is jimbo  carla and ian are half brother and sister there last name is umlauf there grandfather is charles umlauf sculpturist who passed way not too long ago ian and carla are both graduating in december ian is majoring in art and carla in sociology carla is also getting married in may tony is the majoring in engineering he is so sweet then there is me sophomore here at majoring in elementary education little brother is jimbo he is going to school in florida in st augustine he is playing baseball at flagler university hope he does well so all of us are in college right now carla ian tony and me all go to school here at the university of texas and jimbo in florida two roommates they are cousins to each other lived with them last year at the dorm things are going okay guess they can get really annoying sometimes glad that own room so do not always have to listen to them because they are cousins they tell each other anything mean that they wi will fight about anything they wi will say things to each other that you normally would not say to roommate like you are being bitch or that looks like shit on you do not know just do not like listening to them all the time they share room and own thank god hope things wi will start settling down  
here trying to think of something to say mind is completely blank this kind of thing always happens when trying to write guess the only thing on mind right now is whether or not going to make it at such big school like ut to walk lot and the studying is sometimes hard music major the time but really hate it think it is worthless major its too much work for nothing music majors do not make any money think that big part of going to college is learning how to make money guess if was really devoted to playing the piano money really wouldnt matter to me but couldnt see myself sitting on ass playing the piano the rest of life really want to do something exciting another thing that is bothering me right now is the fact that go to school hours week and only getting credit for thats four hours not getting credit for all of which are of course music classes only get hours for hour musicianship class and only get hour for hour ensemble class really like it here but miss friends back home think it is going to be weird seeing them again during thanksgiving and christmas want to know how their schools are and if they have been to any good parities or if they have made many friends one thing about going to ut is that it is hard to make friends here because there are so many people though made friends with many people that live with along with some people in classes went to pretty cool concert this weekend went with some of friends that are sti will in high school miss hanging out with them it was like old times again went with old boyfriend and all of his friends was the only girl as always but thats what used to guess to keep attention on what doing here though so that can survive through college think mom is going to be mad because may have maxed out phone card but that is kinda off the subject mind wanders like that sometimes tamesha is beating up her cd player she is sitting next to cursing at her portable cd player now she is blowing the dust out of it because she thinks that it might work better if she does that well time is up and just in time too because mind just went blank again 
right now thinking about girlfriend and what she is doing why is this guy behind me being so loud in the study center almost forgot how to spell center  this guy is trying to be as loud as possible what is going on tonight? sure do have lot of homework why doesnt this guy get megaphone so he can be even louder? shut up please hate this kid why is this girl laying on the couch doing her homework? had fun last night wonder what roommate did this guy is really pissing me off what the hell is his problem? swear to everything that is holy if he does not shut up wi will make the next four years of his life living nightmare what is friend jeremy doing right now? this is boring not hard though this seems so stupid of time its only been five minutes sti will have fifteen more to go what classes do tomorrow? shutup asshole calculus and english one hour classes not too bad tired going to take nap later getting tired of writing getting sleepy what is this guy next to me doing? this guy that walked in is real dork wonder what he did last night only ten minutes to go this jerk is moaning out loud now what is he thinking? going to ki will him this guys headphones are way too loud hungry why? just ate getting tired of waiting this is boring only eight more minutes that to listen to this inconsiderate bastard that guy wants that girl through now going to room to sleep 
just sitting here thinking while wait for clothes to clean while sitting here realize how much life is different in austin rather than two hundred and eighty miles away in nederland for example always had someone to do laundry there and if did it myself never had to wait for washing machine the thing miss most about nederland is not having friends around even though best friend and girlfriend are also attending and both are staying in jester sti will miss other friends lot always thought when came to austin it was going to be so much fun but now realize there is lot of work involved only week has gone by since got here and already have so much to do that is another thing miss about home the ability to do nothing if so desire here doing nothing is not an option feel that if do nothing wi will fall behind and just be wasting time miss the little things about home even though girlfriend lives here miss being able to go to each others house sure we can go to each others dorm rooms but miss the feeling of home and hanging out with her family and mine that is another thing not mentioned yet miss family honestly did not think would but do guess over time wi will grow accustomed to living here and maybe eventually be able to call austin home well its time to put the clothes in the dryer so guess this is the end 
okay begun writing one thing should probably point out as recall the above statement about disregarding grammar is that spend so much time typing on the computer that editing grammar and punctuation as type are second nature to me so its not like gone back and fixed all the errors which doesnt mean that there probably arent any run on sentences in here okay thats been said right now roommate is being fairly loud find that bothersome not sure if hes stupid or inconsiderate id rather be at home right now was spoiled by having to do little to no work over the summer and now having trouble getting the motivation to do anything it made the summer more fun at the time but it was maybe not such good idea ideas are like that because of that whole / hindsight thing looking at the vents on the side of computer and for some reason it struck me that they look like gi wills not looking forward to having to do the other writing assignment which is not to say think itll be difficult but this assignment requires almost no discipline the other one wi will require me to have directed thought and thats not really that big deal but its one thing to sit down ready to do task and another thing to attempt the task when you know exactly how long youre supposed to be doing it what mean to say is that the time wi will seem to pass more slowly because will be watching the clock so will probably be more bored and do not like to be bored not very far into this but train of thought seems to have stopped probably because roommateor actually suitemate room to myself but share refrigerator microwave and two bathrooms with two other guyskeeps playing random notes on his guitar and someone else in his room is speaking very loudly it wouldnt be so bad if hed just shut his door but for some reason he hasnt thought of that theyve wandered outside his room and are now talking very loudly outside of door now now they seem to have left so maybe can concentrate no that did not work found it previously difficult to make mind blank intentionally but now it seems to come quite easily think probably tired the cable system here has more cable changes than the cable at home so when theres nothing else to do usually watch something like comedy central late at night and shave few hours off of healthy amount of sleep thats better times passing quickly now which normally wouldnt like but this is something wouldnt have done if it was not gradeno offense to anyone involved in this researchand when youre forced to do something you want it to end quickly think the air conditioning in this dorm is screwed up its hot right now and had to buy fan earlier to keep it semi-cool in room it doesnt work all the time like right now the fans blowing on me but not cool there he goes again think roommates playing sympathy for the devil now which isnt so bad because thats good song tried to learn the piano once but did not stay on it for very long found that the teacher was really good for nothing because could learn everything she taught from the book itself but when stopped going to lessons found too many other things to occupy time and stopped practicing would have liked to have been able to play the keyboard parts in several rolling stones songs and several other of the older bands songs most modern music is pretty much no good and that brings an end to twenty minutes 
thoughts sensations and emotions are always changing with each new experience idea and whatever happens throughout life they are affected sometimes by what other people think and sometimes affected from just maturing and thinking differently right now feel like in control of myself because doing well in school academically socially and mentally school work is very important to me and make sure that do well do not go overboard like lot of friends who study hours every day socially adapted very well in meeting new friends mentally in control and focused on what is going on in life there were some problems that have caused some stress in life since college started first me and roommate got in some petty arguments but now we are getting along just fine also had some guy problems regretted doing some things knew shouldnt have done but now we worked things out and or friendship is even better than before know that ivent been eating right and sleeping enough which is causing some changes in body that cause me to be more tired and weak always go to sleep way too late and wake up early for classes last night friend called at two in the morning and talked to him for hours even though should have eight-o-clock class in very good mood today because everything seems to be working out for me usually nice pleasant person until faced with lot of stress or go through pms then get in really bad mood friends know when to stay away from me the only thing really troubling me right now is all the reading to do for classes the assignments they give us are no problem but the reading is crazy they bombard us with reading assignments that really arent necessary art class for instance requires for the present moment for me to read from pages to -something really do not want to read about all these statues and paintings and sculptures from different eras anyway miss family but not homesick at all how can be when parents call all the time? know they care for me but its really not necessary for them to want to visit every weekend which wi will not allow them to do that sounds mean but theyre going to have to get used to it do miss the free laundry and the home-cooked meals and own room and nice bathroom but oh well

in this present moment feel slightly irritated due to the fact that earlier today was not able to surf the internet on america online the problem of surfing the internet could have been easily solved by going to computer lab in dormitoryjester and logging on to the internet from there however focus was to locate some friends on the internet this feature is exclusive to america online and not possible to achieve in the jester computer lab ultimately gave up and now in the process of typing this stream of consciousness another issue on mind even though it may sound trivial is table tennis earlier in the day friends and were unable to get an open table which irritated me truthfully wi will admit that fairly easily irritated think that large blame on this problem rests on tendency to be perfectionist when things do not get done or do not get done the way that want get really irritated  on good note one good aspect about myself is that realize shortcomings trying best to overcome these bad tendencies that in opinion college means to me clean slate in which can start over trying best to get off and remain on the right foot one of foremost goals is to meet new colleagues and friends friendship is very important to me without friends the road of life would be lonely indeed whether these friends are so called e-friends that keep in touch with over the internet or friends know in person they are equally important  while on the e-friend topic feel compelled to mention an incident that happened to me on the internet met nice female an america online considering that america online is the largest internet provider in the world was very surprised that this person happened to live in close proximity of me we set up rendezvous at coffee house in which we met in person we had good time this just shows how the world is smaller than it seems in addition also keep in touch with e-friends in such places and germany and singapore it is very interesting to converse with them  as you can probably tell very much technophile love anything electronic and especially love computers but of most importance to me as mentioned already are friends guess could say the prevalent topic in this stream of consciousness is friendship to tell the truth if any of e-friends were severed from acquaintance be it by losing touch or just plain not talking to me any more would be extremely upset however know it cant last forever sometimes it seems that nothing wi will last forever guess sometimes we just have to move on

back hurts when sit like this and can feel the little tendon that is inflamed do not really have to think about each letter that type on the keyboard just think about what want to say and it goes from mind through the fingers and into the computer just stopped to think about what to write about next but do not know exactly what thinking so will write about what just thought mind is telling me that it is lunch time and stomach is agreeing think that going to eat healthy today because been slacking off pretty bad should probably eat some of the food that parents gave me this weekend so that roommate doesnt eat it all gosh back hurts damn rain houston has lot of rain probably more than austin think like usstin lot better than houston it is cooler here to there is not nearly as much humidity gosh bad cough why do get depressed so easily think problem is that always trying to please everybody else and not myself guess that is good because it is unselfish but it is life and everybody says that life is short but see there go listening to everybody else again goodness cough headache and back is so screwed up it sucks to go from being very active to nearly useless whole life has been about having fun and playing sports and now it hurts to bad just sitting here it is amazing that was not paralyzed could not imagine what it must feel like to know that you wi will never stand up strait or run or even walk again that suck but see now that situation is not as bad as many peoples what do write now wonder wonder how many people wi will be on sixth street wonder why nose is itching and ivent stopped typing to scratch it it must be zit trying to emerge janel if you read this you probably think that last statement is gross but very frank wonder if going to do good here at ut wonder what song that is being played down the hall so loud wonder if that is oh well the reptilian part of brain is telling me that written for twenty minutes and that should do something else 
know theres nothing wrong can write but sti will feel like whatever writing may not be what they had in mind its about and starving as soon as finish this will get to go and eat just came back from calculus which is at least minute walk away from where which is dobie do not think going to learn too much from the professor for calculus he doesnt ever explain what the hell hes trying to do and like today when this guy tried to ask him he almost yelled at him for jumping ahead it is really frustrating because he first says something and then writes it down verbatim and it makes me really mad he wastes so much class time writing down the obvious even after hes said it ten times tried taking notes but doubt theyll help always loved math but this is just frustrating friend ashli who also lives here nad is from tiny hometown has suitemate named sonia who had him last year she said its horrible slhe only knew two people who got an in his class she was telling me about how he writes down every little thing and now see what she means she also said his tests are nothing like the homework so do not know what to expect so hungry right now did not eat too much this morning because never seeem to be hungry when first wake up roommate is really sick ithink she has strep throat which means itll only be matter of daysbefore get it too immune system has never been that good know know never really exercised that much but never seem tok have too much energy mom always thought was anemic but tests show supposedly not its so weird how whenever walk around campus keep seeing people know well not really know but recognize them from camptexas or orientation or somewhere like that usually do not get to know too many people from placeslike that because tend to be little on the shy side people always toldm id outgrow that but well sti will waiting in fact if theres onet hing could change about me tid probably be that everyone says you can make yourself not be shy but sorry do not know how tried and tried but to no avail when around lot of people know its not too bad like in high school knew everyone in school its small school and weve allb een together since kindergarten and it was never too bad did not love public speaking or anything where lot of attention was directly on me but was always pretty comfortbale around everyone but here feel kind of lonely cousin garrod who is sophomore here says it was that way for him lst year cant even reach one of older friends here do not know what the problem is and other friend called never called back do not know if she just did not get the message or if shes not calling back because she doesnt want to friend ashli and spend lot of time together we eat together and stuff but shes already separating form me little bit at least were going to the football game together looking forward to the game miss football never eallly appreciated it until played powder puff last year somehow always feel like overlooked because quiet at lest hope its because quiet and not just because easy to overlook the youngest in family and whenever older brother would be talking to mom she would always listen to him and ignore me no matter what was saying until he left the room honestly they thought because younger that whatever say cant possible be as important as what hes saying could be telling her the house is one fire while he was telling her how he drove to town and she wouldnt listen do not get me wrong she has always been great mom but that has always bothered me maybe more than it shoyuld do not really believe in those horoscope things but sometimes when read them at the end of theday some eerie things ahave been true anyway read one of them on the ocmptuer first of all never been typical sagittarius like the magazines and articles say they say theyre all outgoing and at times painfully shy nad introverted well the one read on the computer said the way to most hurt feelings was to ignore me and thats true if one of friends is total asshole to me wi will usual forgive them if they wi will just pay some attentin to me do not think too many people in life that can count on and thats really what need most do not know if theres anyway can fix that but its been long years this probalby sounds like manic depressive but before you call the authorities let me assure you not just do not have very high self esteem at times and often feel like all alone in the world ahve fear that will never find anyone to love me like husband do not see how someof these other people manage to meet tons of guys while always alone and most of those girls do not even appreciate them and know would maybe its back to the shyness thing really do not know but wish whoever did wuold tell me do not know what want to do with life was hoping classes this smester would help but do not know part of me wants to go into business but by the time get accepted into the business school may change mind again in the natural sciences thing as an undeclared pre-med right now but who knows howl ong that wi will last? not lazy but it takes me hwile to get readjusted into going back to school and even though was in two ap classes senior year and graduated valedictorian by long shot never had to work too hard in school this stuff just came naturally to me

really know what should write about guess feeling alright class was cancelled for today so had the whole day off rented sling blade which liked the movie had people with psychological problems like the guy who is always talking about women he ki willed and the main character who cuts peoples heads open every once in while if he feel it is necessary the keyboard on the computer sucks since the space bar key keeps on sticking whenever try to push it down kind of nervous about classes because last semester screwed up grade wise after keeping an almost  gpa for and / semesters never taken psychology before in high school and wish had since it would make the class easier now when take it really cant type continuously for twenty minutes without having definite subject so keep having to stop and think of something to type one of goals this semester is to stop watching tv so often because that is what feel screwed me up last semester since was always staring at the screen either their or while surfing the web now beginning to feel little grossed out because was just thinking about our dorm meeting where they told us housekeeping comes in only every other day to clean the bathroom when they used to come every day and it was sti will pretty dirty now it is going to be even worse guess it has been about twenty minutes now forgot what time started typing at since forgot to write it down thought would have remembered so just going to call it night 
so far this class seems alright means the girls in this class look pretty good theres this one girl in there ivent talked to her yet but to because she always looking at me she looks pretty cute but can tell she is young theres this other hispanic girl who has real tight curly hair she looks incredible shit all the girls in there do well who ever is reading this can probably tell hat think about sex lot its strange because always find myself daydreaming about having wife and kids you know having real family going to visit folk and other friends with kids but it like no how hard try after sex with lady just lose total respect for them just look at there flaws and only look at the negative with me the way think about girl is totally different after we engage in hot intense intimacy some times do not know if it is just irrational thought processes or what know its not normal but what is normal normal is what society says is ok but who is the society whites blacks hispanic the melting pot of the us or the world there are so many different cultures and societies that essayist that who is to say that their ways are better then anybody elses how can you say that is right and that is wrong because society deems it that way if society is forever changing are our moral standards to be forever changing as well well it has been so far in our human history   times up nice talking with you 
worried about how can save until the end of september need to buy books and groceries and personal stuff thinking that need to find part time job somewhere on-campus very soon also feel guilty about not going home to family over labor day know should visit them but every time spend long periods of time with them ie days they really start to piss me off and then get into bad mood so instead of going to visit them over labor day think going with some friends to visit some friends in houston miss friends back home this school is really big and sometimes feel all alone classes are starting to stress me out especially rhetoric and composition class cannot write very well so probably wi will not do well in that class feel like writing in diary which is wierd because never kept diary contains all thoughts and feelings when was little and had diary just wrote what ate for lunch and who sat and played with at reces or who had crush on just found bobby pin in hair from last night thats kind of embarrassing hope no one saw it supposed to keep writing for ten more minutes but do not really know what else to write to e-mail mom cousin and some friends later hope friend doesnt have to go to jail no one has heard about his trial that was the other day maybe will call them later on and find out what happenned so hungry cant wait for lunch sont know why been getting cravings for salty foods because usualy would always look for ice cream but lately had cravings for chex mix pizza chips and stuff like that hope fi willed out the right pre-testing survey for psychology because saw button you click on in this web page but this isnt the one that went to forgot to bring pencil with me wonder what ex-boyfriend is doing now sti will miss him even though he was big jerk and really do not want to get back with him think people wi will always have feelings for their exes even long after theyve broken up miss sister too we never really got along until about or months ago feel bad about never really being nice sister always teased her and knew it hurt sometimes wrote her letter before went to college hope shes read it think been writing for minutes but not sure so will keep writing for two more minutes hmm well this kind of makes me feel better to let all of thoughts out instead of keeping most of them inside head 
think about mother ex-boyfriend in houstonof whom sti will in love with and just things that are going on in life right now all of the stressed of being on own and all this is just really overwhelming and for some reason during all of this listen to the most depressing torimos or sarah mclachlan song after good cry always feel better think its healthy to cry though think its good to deal with things rather than to create something to do and keep yourself busy dealing with things for me is the best way to get over them but sometimes tend to obsess over things rather than just simply dealing with them straight out seem to have reverted back to pre-teen years when would cry myself to sleep because mother was no longer with me parents got divorced at that time about when was years old or so remember every night listening to sad music and just crying because missed her she and one of the best relationships ever seen between parent and child she is friend not just mother but do not cross boundaries respect them wholly and recognize them way in advance think some people take advantage of when they are friends with their parental unit use it to their advantage just respect it and cherish it with all heart quote sarah mclachlan and the sense to recognize that do not know how to let you go  think that line has described relationship with boyfriend for the past year weve broken up twice but we always seem to end up in each others lives at some point or another guess its good thing hes wonderful person and great person for me but just do not know if can do this be in love with him have relationship what have you with him being in houston and me here in austin do not know if want him calling me telling me how much he misses me and telling me he loves me when hes two hours away guess its not that much of distance compared to other peoples long distance relationships but think it takes certain type of person to be in one of those certainly know theyre not for me and from his past experiences with them all bad know hes not too keen on the idea either miss him terribly touching him smelling him his humor his voice everything e-mail and phone conversations do not suffice just got new laptop and wrote friend this huge letter with like six big paragraphs and hit this button on accident and it deleted the whole thing ugh hate this thing but really do not like having it to take to the library just need to learn how to do everything and what not to do not into reading these huge dictionary size manuals on things they just do not interest me that much much more of trial and error person except when it comes to math basically because do not want to sit there for hours trying to figure something out want formula there for in face were doing these circuit things in that class that is all trial and error right now its total bitch made three really cool friends in that class one of friends tim saw at club the other weekend and remember him from the hallway in which we were both lost together wish he were cuter hes really nice guy and made these two other friends traciesame name as best friend and stephanie theyre both really cute and tracie seems like shed be lot of fun to go out and party with she was telling me about her cousins friend whos gay and just moved to new york to go into fashion imagine that but would love to go to new york especially after seeing that movie perfect murder mean know not everyone there has huge penthouse on central park but would love to just go visit it love the whole image of it its just very chic for some reason would live there if could get very high paying position somewhere but thats the only way would its just too crowded otherwise 
many whys are predominant why do seem to feel unwanted at times? why do seem to feel betrayed at times why do seem to feel like failure at times? why do seem to have lost yearn for optimism? many of these feelings come and go but many do stay implanted in head head is just constant waterfall tons of ideas rushing through mixing at point which creates pandemonium head is maze which produces many blocks such as this wall why when mother phones me become bored all of sudden? love her dearly and know that she must be lonely with all her kids off to college it is because she misses me and because she loves me why cant make that extra effort to make her feel wanted what cant give her the same feeling that she makes me feel emotions run one-sided in her phone calls feel superfluous feeling of want and she must not feel any corrections can be made to this but just do not try how can think that determined to do well in college? how can feel that wi will be persistent and successful in life? if can feel determined persistent and successful in these things then why is it that feel determined persistent and successful right before speak to mom in order to make her feel wanted and then fail is this preview of what is to come in future not only with family relations but also with life experiences wi will continue to think can and wi will continue to fail? how can practice ways to perfect them how can execute feelings and hopes how can make them come true how many times do to continue to tell myself that this is the way its going to be or that that is the way it is going to be and in the back of mind know that it wi will never be the way that intend it to be does this mean that failure? what does it mean? should it be something to worry about wi will mother some day get fed-up with me can this defect ruin entire life? is it defect? why do think about this stuff? is it just conscious nature? why all these whys do not know but what do know is that there is purpose for everything and maybe purpose of life was to wonder why

well the writing assignment its right now and to write writing assignment for psychology class which absolutely do not see point in writing this paper extremely tired from working out and playing basketball and stomache is very empty as of now few chocholate chip cookies with milk would be nice hey this pcl is full of asians and right in front of me is friend michaels sister sorry had to pause for few second to stop and to talk with them theyre pretty cool she thinks that talk too loud well screw her wonder if we could use inappropriate languages in this assignment because stream of consciousness is one thats pretty dirty and fi willed with foul language better not cuss its and its very interesting that brains could only output lines of useless junk in minutes feel like that not using brain to its full potential or maybe just very slow typer damn wrist hurts so glad that only have classes tomorrow intro to western music is such crappy class thought it was suppose to be blow off but its not and its pissing the living explisive out of me tone deaf dumb as hell when it comes down to music and plain retarded when to distinguish the difference between duplet triplet or quatriplet in opinion not that it really matters in the bigger scheme of things but its sti will best to be aired out is that music should be enjoyed by an individual not to be dissected into grammarical structures the class kinda reminds me of dead poet society how the text books actually graphs the meter and accents of the poem music like poetry suppose to be heard by the heart not interpreted by the brain when hear beathoveens th symphony cant tell the meter and texure of the piece but all know is that heart are soaked with energy that makes the musical experience quite elemertary yet much more enjoyble guess should quit bitching to that class since its myself who signed up the class without any foreign intervention nor pressure so who should blame but myself just saw andrews friend walking in the liabrary why did not say hello just because the way he looks is he not cool enough when we went to that frat house last weekend feel like that hes such burdensome tag-along yet would some of other friend feel the same about me?? its very disturbing how disgusted by all those people who think they are too cool for certain peeps yet fall under the same disgusting catorgory which loath its so confusing when heard from say that hes not coming to the thursdsay mixer was some what relieved relieved of what?? of people not thinking that cool frat boy beacause of richard but who really cares what those lambda thinks? or those skanky katie phi girls think??? why do care so much about what other people think instead of thinking for myself and doing something that know is right it bugs me how proclaim self to be genuine nice guy when cant even perform the easiest task of bring somebody along with me and having good time with him damn so freaking superficial and it annoys the heck out of me to really discover yourself before discovering that really special someone right now do not think deserve her just hope that she doesnt come right now and wait for me to mature and evovle into better person the loud oversized vacumm cleaner is distracting flow of thoughts and brain kinda froze for sec think those few clear moments where youre brain is not thinking anything at all is one of the healthiest state human can be well as another vacuum cleaner joins the library noice parade shall conclude this essay to admit though despite early feelings this assignment has some enjoybal value to it and actually kinda glad that given this blank sheet that can send thoughts into the void of carelessness and its rather refreshing bid you farewell though do not know who bidding to its 
right now sitting in front of the computer completing this assignment really wish that had worked on this assignment earlier now starting to worry because to finish calculus homework and read few pages for engineering and to finish that one problem that no one can seem to get it is bugging me that left that one problem unfinished it is also bugging me that left that problem blank and completed the others out of turn never thought about that before but do get bothered when things arent completed in the order that theyre supposed to be weird just had an epiphany it is really weird how you think of things at the strangest time whats also weird is how you can sometimes say word over and over and if you say it enough times it starts to sound really weird like word youve never heard before take before before before before before before before see it starts to sound really foreign that is really odd and it works with every word too hmm thoughts are all scrambled now not thinking of much anymore used to think of how much missed home now it is not so prominent do not think of roshi as much sti will do sometimes but it comes and goes not going to let myself get trapped like before it is just vicious cycle feel much better this time somehow learned to overcome sadness dunno exactly how it happened but learned to overcome and bypass it it doesnt consume me anymore like it used to now that think about it really starting to wonder how managed to do that inherently think that can get fixated easily that right there is sign that bound to get hurt one of these days and but learned the question is how? hmm oh well no matter now as long as can do it that is good enough for me maybe its the college atmosphere being alone and on own in sense anyway look around room and realize that do not miss home do not know why missa family and friends at time but do not miss them its weird maybe its because do not consider myself away from them mysha said that this was like camping trip and everytime we went home was no different than coming back from vacation hmm do not think thats so but it certainly did not feel too different on labor day maybe need to stay away from home longer hmm that must be it mysha got me thinking about roshi again hmm makes me wonder how easy it is to meet people here it cant be too hard lots of people have already met people jsut need to go and try steve knows how to do it but he has nothing to lose he has girlfriend at home so he doesnt care much about making lot of friends comes natural to him though honestly think that that is the only thing really bugging me here feel an immense sense of confidence all except for that liking the way handling things liking the way kinda built back work ethic and liking the fact that can make own decisions starting to feel better and better about college life it is great except for all the people there is something srange about the people here something difficult to finger sort of fakeness many people are geniune but there are others which seem unapproachable people do not act the way used to seeing them act in high school maybe that is it asians do not act like asians at home for one thing most other people act the same but the asians here do not little different little meaner? that cant be it though really need to meet more and judge ugh feel like just cursed myself for saying that really did not mean that being too cynical guess but you cant win them all happy otherwise met few good friends like the campus and close to home feel connected in all aspects ut was probably one of the best choices ever made dad thinks so he told me the other night always hated when he judges whats good and bad based on what he thought but he is right this time he usually is learned almost always need to learn to respect that the one whos usually wrong oh well better late than never time for calculus

well hmmm not sure whtat to wirte here to monitor the mind suppose ihahve always been fascinated that the mind is the only organ that wants to study itself horrible typer id like to think fast but as what cost of accuracty uhhhh this is strange trying to monitor stream of consciousness but so aware of it as perform this assignment that it does not seam to want to flow do not want to write down anything too embarrasing but why should that matter? in college not high school anymore social status amongst peers really doesnt have any more bearing here it doesnt matter what people think of me now do not have to worry about appearanc all the time though sti will do suppose thats how shallow to always know that looking good so that way can feel good about myself that helps me exude confidence and thats attractive to women but not here to get mate here to get an education degree so that way can be financially secure for the rest of life but is that what the ultimate goal in life is think about this is the ultimate goal in life to make money settle down and start family to break this down means to say that we are to reproduce buy why? what is this necessary drive in humans and all creatures to propegate and keep the species going basic nature to survive sure but then again why?? it seems like there should be other goals and other things to achieve in life not necessarily to have children wi will having children when older make me happy suppose so mean am exactly like father as he is exactly like his father before him after all already on the right track they both went to ut but as much as fought with dad in the past think that done most everything in life to please him and make him proud of me pretty sure that done that as he tells me that he is proud of me sure saw it in his face the day that got acceptance letter never really seen father cry before but think he almost did when yelled out that going to be longhorn thats something that wi will never forget the look on his face and the look on moms it makes me feel good to know that they are proud of me but often wondered whether or not the things that accomplished in life did for myself or did for them mean never regreted getting good grades or being in band and learning to play the trumpet but did do it all for myself or did do it partly because wanted mom and dad to be proud of me and to not have to be worried about me hoping wi will not turn out like adam its not that brother is bad person its his mind right manic-depressive with bi-polar and narcisstic tendencies and his refusal to take his medication why?? never understood what was so hard about taking his meds hed be fine but instead he chose drugs and alcohol its so weird felt so bad like it was something that could have fixed something that was problem that had the answer to but it just wouldnt come out of brain consciously know thats not true but deep down sti will wish that there was something that could have done to keep him from hurting mom and dad and the rest of the family like he did never saw someone breakdown as much as mother did but adam is better now do not know if hes taking his med but he times up 
sunday and need to go to church since did not go this morning because woke up at and church is at so already took shower and dressed to go at right now its and wish it was about because it seems like the day has just went by and ivent done very much thats alright though because listening to favorite rap music trick daddy dollars ja rule dmx ice cube hot boys juvenile black dangerous k-roc too short twista and jt money they seem to make me feel better even if feeling down in the dumps few rap songs seem to bring me back to reality and happiness earlier girlfriend called and we had serious fight because she gave roommate little attitude yesterday when she called she got mad because was not here and roommate did not know cell number or friends which is where was at so had to lay down the law and tell her not to take out her anger on roommate was mad also because gave her cell number the day before but she did not write it down so we argued for while about that then she told me something that her and her friend did that did not approve of so was instantly angered because short temper to begin with it was big deal really but do not let anything go by even the smallest fuckups so we started to have any even greater argument than the first one and did not end on good note she decided that she did not want to talk to me if we were going to argue acted like did not care so we just ended it there this worries me because hate to end it like that but so hardheaded that wi will not let anyone know that theyre really hurting me it also hard because here and shes miles away and cant see her the way use to guess going to have to get use to this and college is lot different from what use to the girls wooo some of them are pretty fine and all the people never seen so many people in one place at one time being from small town this is totally different atmosphere that not used to hopefully will find place here make the best of it and things wi will turn out great do not want to let college change me in the wrong ways whatever happens will just try to do best and do the best can as things come along 
right now at this moment thinking about what doing here this whole college thing is sti will new to me roommate is getting drunk right now with some guys while in here writing this at least she is meeting people wish could go back in time and be in high school again know that probably sounds stupid and immaturebut had lot more fun in high school had friends all around me was popular was really close to the cutest guys in our school now do not know anyone used to going out like everyday so it is really weird to be actually doing homework you know what really miss? this guy back in arlington named luke he was complete ***hole but was and sti will am infatuated with him guess it is infatuation would like to think love him but know that logically it is not possible for me to love him he was first you know one of those catholic girls and never thought would lose it to some stupid high school boy but it happened wish that it would have happened and would not have had any feelings for him but do he has girlfriend who is younger than we are and insanely jealous why could he establish relationship with her and not me and why is it that he cheats on her with me? these questions boggle mind and make me upset know deserve better one of those catholic upperclass spoiled girls everything but what want luke goes to pepperdine university and is far away but no one here has even caught eye thought once went to school life would just be incredibly better well it really has not college is not what thought it would be know it is only like the middle of the third week so need to give it time freedom is great though like not having to check in with the paternals what is the great thing about that if never use that priveledge also thinking about how psychology class is during bad time mean class is at and that is about the time want to go to dorm and sleep or just relax wish could change time but it is too late now oh well also think that burdine hall is the hardest building to get to missed class today because could not find it hope we did not do anything important hate chemistry dr white goes too fast and does not make sense do not know if can survive that class it is going to be tough used to sleeping in all classes never doing homework and just getting by that was high school this is college how miss those good old days really do not think ready for college everybody here is just so smart really miss having people who are dumber than in classes now it seems the dummy the next time do this hopefully wi will be in better mood twenty minutes are almost up and ran out of things to say hope this was interesting and different from all the other assignments that you have recieved bye for now 
never done this before guess will think about day today went shopping with friend we went to little store called oat wi willies it is kind of subculture store it has been around for long time they sell all kinds of hippy novelties- pipes inscense books about drugs and probably drugs too if you know the right people anyways friend bought some sunglasses then as we were walking back friend from highschool came running out of baskin robbins to say hi do not know her very well but she seems really nice then we went into this vintage clothes store they had lot of really soft comfortable looking t-shirts we both tried on couple then the guy that worked there accused us of stealing shirt which was really weird cause niether of us really had anything that we could have hidden shirt in he found this hanger on the rack that did not have shirt on it so guess one of his shirts was missing and feel bad for him but it was sti will kind of insulting to be wrongly accused oh well no big deal for me guess so bought one t-shirt for three dollars and we left maybe his lost shirt wi will turn up somewhere next we went to another little store that sells interesting odds and ends myfriend ended up buying bag that she really liked from nepal it was pretty cheap then we went back to her dorm room and hung out with her suite mates while we decorated her room ok think it has been about minutes hope whoever has to read th 
the computer that on is not very good so oi hope that it doesnt kick me off because it would really suck to have to do this all over again do not reallly understand how writing miscellaneous thoughts wi will help me to learn about psychology do see how it can help others study psychology but what do thoughts have to do with class on introdutory psychology this last few days really missed girlfriend seeing as how she is sti will at home finishing her senior year but thankfully get to go home in days and wi will hopefully get to see her for an entire saturday love her more and more every day which leads me to the conclusion that absence does make the heart grow fonder got job as houskeeper in the union on the weekends from three to midnight the sorry thing is that wi will not get to see any football games and also dad is coming to visit me this weeekend and wi will not get to see me unti will monday because of job the good thing about job is that really wi will not have chance to party been sober for year now and would lie to keep it that way and job wi will hopefully keep me away fromthe parties given up drugs cigarettes and alchohol which leaves me with only reforming dirty mouth the way in which plan to do this is by wearing rubber band around wrist and popping myself everytime cuss also let the people around me know about this so that they can inform me of the times that cass without knowing it college life has been pretty good to me so far but cousin is not responding nearly as well as heard that she calls hrying everynight to her house but think that it is because of the fact that her parents particularly her mother have done everything for her and always spoken for her the entirety of her life now that she is own her own she doesns know what to do with herself feel sorry for her sometimes bt other times think that it is about time she learned what life outside her family is like do hope that things get bette for her and that things stay good for me 
keep thinking about the future and how life wi will alter during and after college wonder how grades wi will be after the first term hope can make parents proud do not want parents to view me as failure and screw up want them to be proud want to be accepted by everyone meet want to succed in life wonder how math test wi will be tomorrow just wish that society did not view people on how much money they make wish could go to place where everyone was the same and there was nothing to worry about maybe the place thinking about is eternal utopia or heaven wonder if there is heaven what happens after death where do we go do we ever see the creator what is the creator is it god or did we evolve through evolution of mico   
right now thinking that college is pretty tough constantly questioning ability to do well in college want to make parents proud yet also want have good time like to party lot little too much probaly just want to know how much partying is too much like to do what makes me feel good and school work does not make me feel good in fact it stresses me out severely wish the world was little simplier wonder if the way our soceighty is good or not successful human beings work their asses off to achieve good living is that the way god wanted it or should we live relaxed life with lots of fun for me that would be partying spending time on the lake and going hunting and fishing is good for humans to work hard and stress there entire life maybe stress is the cause of fatal disease like cancer it seems the more we evolve the more we work and stress things maybe this is leading us into different willnesses do not know do not think one man does know we could be completly on the wrong track or we could be evolving better than what anybody thought we could want finish school and be successful human being but would like to know if this is the right thing to be doing all the human race would say definatly yes but what if we should be living amore relaxed less stressful and more fun life doing what makes each person feels good could be the answer life just seems funny because people are not robots they could do whatever they want but we choose to go to college and try to be successful maybe people just go through all the trouble to make money someday but if you think about it money is created by humans and if every wanted it they could just give it to everyone all of this might not seem logical but human and these are some of the thoughts that go through head going to listen to myself to and not be something not want to succeed and make everyone proud but also going to have lot of fun 
why so stressed out is it school or is it what is going on in life no clue its probably becasue freshman or is it because just do not know what am doing in this school its too hard do not know how to work the computer system tons of homework and its all catching up to me at the same time its unreal so bogged down with work and so much stuff to do but sitting here typing on computer on something that do not know wi will even get sent to you friends are talking to me while trying to write this assignment and cant make mind focus on on certain thing at all the music is too loud and people trying to talk to me over the internet these blinking lights are pissing me off wish these people would shut up and let me tend to business at hand need to read do pre cal and just do not have the time do not know how to do physical science lab and reading just takes too muck time date tonight do not have time to take them out but to or that wouldnt be nice going through rush and that takes up more time than anything cant deal with this anymore its starting to drive me crazy but hopefully soon wi will get used to it its such change from senior year to freshman year of college you go from doing nothing basically to have to read every night and do all sorts of written assignment its impossible twenty minutes is up got to run
