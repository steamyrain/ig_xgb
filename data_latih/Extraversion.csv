love this song it reminds me of plano and when hung out with my old friends wonder where theyre at right now wonder if theyre ok and if theyre doing well at college wheres my roommate he should be back by now he must be eating wonder why this keeps skipping know its not scratched cant wait till tonight cant forget about my laundry in twenty minutes it better still be there when go for it or somebodys losing leg actually trust most everyone on this floor because theyre all pretty cool and met most all of them the guy down the hall hes pretty cool he just is not used to texas life the heat yes since hes from hawaii but the people no should rush frat or not there are many great advantages to this but really do not want to join bunch of guys do not know and find out theyre bunch of losers or drugees guess ill never know until decide to join its just whether or not think theyre cool lot if not all of my friends have joined frat so can find out who likes their frat and who does not to figure out which one id like to rush or pledge actually rushing them all because there is no reason not to my sister will give me the drop since she went here not to long ago ill ask here and get here to help me out because lot of her friends are alumnis of the better frats this part of the song is the best it always makes me feel so happy like could do anything wait one sec to sing along dangit when is susan going to call back there are so many plano people here in austin feel like at high school all over again just bigger neighborhood to party in do not like driving here to much because there are no medians and the speed limits arent posted anywhere not used to having to drive sooo aggressively here mean always drive aggressively but wonder if people here take offensive driving instead of defensive driving now it is time for me to go take safe walk since my car is so dang far away
constantly thinking about the past often think about the good things that have occurred in my highschool years feel really sad because miss my family so bad always thinking about how never get in trouble anymore because my parents arent here to get mad at me whenever come home late feel so lonely here nobody knows anybody everywhere turn see different faces that probably wont ever see again this semester feel so depressed because my boyfriend is gone always dreaming about being together again but its not going to happen ever because we just broke up miss him so bad and cant ever be with him anymore just because too much darn pride wish didnt have so much pride pride gets me nowhere all it does is leave you wondering what could have been or where would be standing now with him had not been so proud so sad but then again would rather have alot of pride than no pride at all wonder what going to do with my life everybody seems to know exactly what they are good at do not totally lost do not know what the best at how are you supposed to know what career is the best one to choose want to do good in school but people do not work to the best of their ability unless they have certain goals not determined do not know if will be successful dancing ballet or operating on some dying person too confused happy my brother love him so much do not know what would do without him really hungry didnt have breakfast lunch or dinner because was too mad about my boyfriend or exboyfriend should say cant think or sleep or eat do not know what to do should let go of all of this pride that no it will be better for me in the longrun why do people get hurt so much do not understand my mind knows that things happen for reason know deep down inside that for some reason this happened and that things will get better but hurting so bad inside and still want to smile at people and say hi to my friends even when do not want to talk to anybody do not understand why to feel horrible and my friends are all having blast why do some people live the best life and others do not get it so easily its not fair to have some people be happy all the time and others who are born without an arm or whos parents have died or who have some sickness why them and not me for example
think one of the shortest attention spans for some reason cant concentrate on one thing for more than fifteen minutes was never diagnosed as though do not think d just think do not put forth the effort to concentrate was trying to read for english but couldnt keep my mind on it for anything every time sat down to read go sleepy try to stay focused but its hard wonder why my concentration is so limited think it all depends on what interested in can read things relating to the human anatomy all day but trouble focusing on things dealing with english or history my mind often starts wondering really had to adjust these first few weeks not only did to adjust academically but socially even though group of best friends still miss my friends back home my mom sister and are best frinds and its is pretty hard because cant just pick up the phone and call them it took couple of day for me to realize this also have boyfriend back home this has also been hard its been hard for both of us we were in the habit of talking everyday and seeing each other quite often now hes three hours away think hes taking it little harder than im keeping busy so not constantly thinking about him theres so much going on here between keeping on top of all of my classes and hanging out theres no more time left in the day weve been having so much fun the other five girls hang out with are great we all bonded so quickly they really help to keep me focused on what need to do of coarse with group this big personalities flare and we have disagreements but surprisingly instead of holding grudges we talk it out females are stereotyped as being gossipy and shady yes we do gossip but if we say something behind someones back you can guarantee its already been said to their face so far everythings been going pretty smoothly hope this bond that is present now remains present for the next four years its difficult to say if it will because we cant predict the future and people change when were just sitting around we talk about our future as friends already asked them to be bridesmaids at my wedding who knows when that will be do not plan for it to be any time soon but do hope our friendship will at least last that long friendship is very important thing to me it gives sense of warmth and belonging its like we have known each other for years hope nothing but good will come out in due time
finally getting to write this should have done this two weeks ago well my girlfriend came by shes in high school still and shes going to miss the rest of the day to be with me but first she has to go to the doctor really love her alot damn hate it when people call me and want all this information they really piss me off dalmatians arent good dogs once they get bigger they are really mooding and alot are being brought to the animal shelter do not work there or anything just heard it on the radio work at the library but not working today because broke my finger playing softball with my brother got hits but its nothing like baseball going to walk on at ut but do not know if ill make it or not but going to give it my best try me and my girlfriend have been going out for month now we met about months ago and dated bit then but nothing serious ever happened thats probably because was still hung up over my old girlfriend but know its just me and her and we are in love weve only had sex once and think thats good because with my exgirlfriend thats all we ever did when we were with each other and it became pure sexual do not want that to happen with erinmy girlfriend now really really want to get serious with her think found the girl could spend the rest of my life with sounds strange but really think anyway wish shed hurry up and get back miss her think the reason we havent had sex more often is we never have the opportunity her parents or grandmother are always home and my parents are home too but think that will change hope we stay together forever and know shes does because she feels stronger about our relationship than do so know wont have anything to worry about six more minutes and finished oh well think this is fun the simpsons are stupid use to like it when was younger but now think its just stupid going to kill myself just kidding my brother and his wife are both psychology majors my brother went to swt for fours years and know is police officer and his wife went to texas for like she was on the deans list and everything shes super smart well getting on out of here its was nice talking but need to go to class
duty is to get date tonight for friday when we have our mixer that is based looking forward to meeting some more girls than already know believe that this stuff is fun whether or not it takes whole lot of my time although not had enough time to work out as much as would like feel as though losing some muscle tone the food at towers does not help with the dirth of suitable protein source the food is extremely inedible very hard time consuming enough food to keep my normal body weight up at dinner usually eat with either my pledge brothers or my roommates my roommates are nice guys even if my suite mates are afraid of girls and this hampers our activities large amount of laundry to do but really do not feel like doing it to acquire red wing boots by tomorrow or my team will lose the game school is strange because never sure if done all my work or if need to study some stuff more it is hard to judge how much you need to study when you have never taken college test before reckon the tests will be fairly challenging although think my high school prepared me well for these tests need to ask date to the rice football game but not sure just who to ask the football games are cool although my ticket at the first game had my on the highest row possible think ricky williams is good although he is not as good as jamal williams of tennessee think texas will lose by large margin to ucla then they will get stomped by kansas state we will finally win at rice but then we will win at the other teams think although the schedule is mystery cant wait to go home to memphis at thanksgiving to see all my friends and my freaking car wish could play more basketball and release my athletic energies
really confused right now because this girl that think is so incredibly attractive and fun and nice and well you get the picture anywho she says that she likes me its just that she does not want serious relationship totally understand that because the more that think about it do not want that either not really sure what it is that want know that just want someone to be there for me it would be nice to have someone who you always know will be there maybe should just explain to her that not asking her for marriage just asking for her to be there for me when need her and will always be there for her when she needs me in high school really was kind of guy who moved around lot could never be satisfied with one person for an extend period of time mean hell just got bored but with her it is different the first day we met we stayed up until am the next day just talking on my friends couch in his dorm room then we fell asleep together on the couch and when we got back up we just started talking again only know her for week but feel like know her forever mean found out so much about her in such little time sometimes do not know that much about people whom know forever do not know do not know just do not know women are so darn confusing well maybe it is the situation that is actually confusing not her or maybe it could be me well guys arent confusing mean we say what we mean and girls just read way to much into it guess just want her to feel the same way about me that feel about her however there is lot going on this fall just started college and think that may be the reason that she does not want boyfriend and thinking about joining either the business council the management information systems association or the iron spikes they are the baseball teams spirit organization with all of this maybe wont have time for her and would not want to be so into her then have her start liking me and stop liking her would feel so bad if that happened just want good girl who will treat me like deserve to be treated and like me for who guess should just give it some time things happen for reasons and who am to think can change someone well guess if really wanted to could manipulate her into doing what want too good at doing that it kind of scares me but what the hell would that accomplish nothing well nothing good can come of it atleast someone once said that we are who we are today because of the choices we made yesterday so going to make choice to just let things run their course if it is meant to happen then it will if not no big deal side thought not the fastest typer and my fingers are starting to get stiff side thought is over not really sure what this writing assignment is going to accomplish but hope it helped you as much as it helped me it actally gave me chance to sit down for minutes and actually reflect on something that has been bothering me for few days wow this psychology stuff is pretty cool may just have to minor in this starting to like it
homework in the midst of my precal assignment because my precal is too long and really rather boring plu need to catch up because didnt start doing homework until the begiining of this week instead of doing little each night my mistake hope to finish this writting assignment the pretest my precal assignment and read some for astrology tomorrow its lot but it will catch me up then tomorrow can begin my new precal assignment and can focus on my art project thurs and if necessary can catch up on more psy and precal thursday evening also going to lunch with my frien james on thursday james is very good friend of mine and whenever need to talk or unload my thoughts james is excellent plus ill put in good couple of hours at my intern david is going to teach me how to use my dads camera and stuff so that sunday can run another photo shoot and have some pictures developed then ill have those pictures to play with and plan on getting some of my negativesput on cd disk so can manipulate those pictures also very busy life going right now do not know how cram it all in sometimes but honestly like to have something to do at all times do not know why not very good at sitting still alone only if watching or something ill get my new job schedule on thurs just changed jobs because was tired of working at the old one that and hadnt received raise in year the sad thing is do not know if ill be getting paid any more at this new place as long as do not take pay cut ill stay just need new enviroment with new things to do ill be working at bath and body works think itll be fun because like the things they sell there and get to be the saleswomen enjoy selling things to people my managers seem nice also might have to work at five in the morning few times year and not looking forward to that at all never done inventory before so do not know what it involves but do not see the point in getting workers to the store at such an early hour if wed be more productive little later even seven sounds more reasonable id rather not worry about that until know for sure that ill be going in that early wonder what youre gather from all of my ramblings five more minutes to go do not know how this is suppose to go whather should just write wahts on my mind or as if talking to you at the other end gues in the end theyre both going to get you the same stream of con types of thoughts huh hope can log onto the pretest when done with this tried it first and the server wouldnt let me on yours or mine do not know do not like computers much any how guess this was as good way as any to put off the rest of my precal since being productive in the mean time could have gone and watched tv or read my book not some school assignment well now that wasnt hard at all guess good at rambling my times up
looking forward to this game all week because last week they beat michigan the defending national champions also it does not help that most of my friends are antinotre dame so when they lose it makes it even worse really thought that if notre dame could beat the national champions they could beat michigan state who is unranked besides that today has been kind of slow because didnt wake up until about it was long night the last couple of weekends have been like this stay out until or so and then sleep till or the next day when you wake up this late it really ruins the entire day because you think that most of the day is gone and you really cant get going also the weather has not helped the situation think the weather had been me more inclined to stay in my room and just sit around not that thats really bad it just kind of makes you feels unproductive it is kind of nice that it had been cooler the last few days been looking forward to wearing more long sleeve cold weather stuff but since it has been raining its been kind of pointless besides been trying to make it more cold than it really is last night planned on wearing long sleeve sweater sort of thing but when went outside for little while found it really wasnt all that cold it was just cooler than normal right now also look forward to the next couple of weeks because planning on join the mavericks the basketball spirit association for the university this has also made me kind of nervous though because hear that it is very straining physically hear that when you are first pledging you have to wake up at am to work out with the group this will probably suck because out of shape when it comes to running and cardiovascular stuff they also have to lift weights but do not mind that so much because do that anyway hope that this organization will be worth my time and effort so it will be fun but do not want to do it for while and then quit because do not like the people well the cowboy game is on right now we are loosing but its ok all this football stuff is getting me ready to play football this is my favorite sport we are getting few teams together this year hope at least one will win there division would really like one of those intramural champion shirts but they are hard to get because so many teams play each year do think this year that will be able to win one because will know all the guys on my team last year played on an independent team and none of us knew each other really am looking forward to football this year it is almost time to go eat now and my writing time is about done and starting to drift out of the trance was in when was writing this few minutes ago this is actually pretty fun exercise its weird to see how my thought drift from one to the next was surprised to see how much wrote and how fast the time went by

very stressed out right now for several different reasons for starters was half way done typing this paper when my computer messed up and everything was erased also fake nails which makes it very difficult to type at this moment trying to write this psychology paper yet all can think about is everything else to do wish had pen and lots of post it notes with me at all times because always thinking of things that need to be done yet can never seem to remember them constantly bombarded with thoughts of what books need to go buy what sections need to read for what class and how going to pass this semester living in castilian it is wild and very loud which makes it very difficult to study also my exboyfriend derek is in the hospital he has multiple sclerosis and it happens to be very bad right now feel so guilty because not had the chance to visit him since he has been admitted into the hospital think that my mom and are going to send him some flowers though we broke up almost two months ago and he has had difficult time excepting that fact it makes me sad to know that he is in the hospital doing absoultely nothing while away at college having the time of my life do not want him to think do not care about him anymore or that forgotten about him but this is my own way of really moving on last night we had our first date dash for my sorority invited this guy named jordan who lives at castilian he is really good looking and we had lot of fun together last night usually intimidated by good looking guys but for some reason find him very easy to talk to we also had fun dancing together which is definate plus because often feel selfconscious when dancing with goodlooking guys little upset becuse he left me after we got back to castilian he told me that he was going to go talk to his friends for few minutes and that he would be right up too bad he came up an hour later when we had already left not even that mad though because know he feels very bad about it hoping that he invites me to delt pledge line also very excited because this guy met and dated at camp this summer wrote me an email it may sound pathetic but was really glad to get it he is lot older than so was expecting him to forget about me after camp we are planning on getting married in four years as long as college does not change me he is ta at ou and is one of the most interesting guys ever met we share lot of the same beliefs and have such good time together when graduate from college we are going to move to beach in mexico together we just sarcastically talk about that but wouldnt mind it being reality the other night put some closure on an event that had needed to for years it felt really good to do that and now going to put closure on this paper because all can think about is what need to do and how need to be back up at school soon so can start getting ready for the game
think college is going to be the best part of my life coming from my high school it seemed hopeless to find place where id fit in ut has such wide diversity of people and so many ways to meet new people that think will have no problem finding someone like me of course right now still little shy about talking to people but hopefully that will change really want to join soroity and become active in as many hispanic and other multicultural events or projects as my schedule will allow maybe this will help me find the kind of people that can relate to me even though only know couple of people on campus feel more comfortable there than ever did in high school outside of school things are good at home all the love and support than can ever ask for from my family without them do not know where id be love them very much do not know why cant tell them that guess just too stubborn also get lot of support from my boyfriend even though didnt really want boyfriend glad hes there he brings lot of fun to my life hope school does not take away my time for him know its going to though ecspecially if join all the organizations that want overallim satisfied with everything know its going to be long and hard four years but looking forward to walking the stage with an engineering major
this is the first writing assignment of the semester you had said in our first meeting that we could write out rough draft before we submitted this copy to you figured that since this is stream of consciousness writing that it would be best if this were written straight to you without proofreading or rewriting well today got back from visiting home for the labor day weekend feeling really homesick right about now think its even worse than when first left home for the first time to move to ut but sure as the week goes on ill adjust again think that as the year progresses and visit more often the coming back to school when the weekend is over will get lot easier because it will become routine type of thing have you noticed that started all the paragraphs with the exception of this one with the word well think thats word use to start off thoughts that do not know how to start off do not know if thats good or bad but who really cares right this is not rhetoric the first football game is this coming weekend my first longhorn football game ever of course seen games on tv but being at the game is always better and more exciting just the like the san antonio spurs always watch them on tv but being at the game is so much fun just learned this weekend that someone from my graduating class is in my psychology class this is not person that ever talked to in fact never even knew who he was until good friend of mine started dating him guessing he saw me in the class when we first met last thursday didnt see him though as you know there are people in that class last night as was falling asleep started thinking about the homework that need to get done then started thinking about this writing assignment couldnt fall asleep because couldnt remember when this assignment was due in my head continuously thought is it due the th or the th of course always been this way always seem to contradict myself in elementary school would lay awake at night trying to remember if had finished all the work that was assigned to me would literally get up every night to check my backpack to make sure it was all finished and that had put it all into my bag for the next day feeling going to be this way in college my biggest fear is failing know that if work hard wont but cant help feel this way wow has it been minutes already yes it has got class in minutes this was fun got to go
hi ben been looking forward to this assignment since heard of it how often do get chance to get credit for babbling on blank sheet of computer apologize cant spell to save my life and the point of this is to write not to write well so anyway listening to emenem right now do not want to give the reader the impression that into the popular mtv crap music that is so prevalent now its just that it has good beat and can type fast to it man pity whoever has to read this let me ask you question have you ever considered that there is not one universal reality but actually different reality for every person on this planet was at party this weekend and this thought was on my mind no wasnt high mean think about it id go into this more but id have to stop typing and try to organize my thoughts more and that would just slow me down really like ut that was on my mind ok here comes the random babbling like austin people here are like no other on the planet if ever situation existed for an all out consciousness revolution it would be in austin so anyway have you ever read any james joyce he sucks cant stand him brought that up because he has the same weird ass choppy writing style that using right now usually do not like to write like this my papers usually make much more sense and my thoughts are much more clear suppose could try to flub this and actually write instead of babble but promised my roommates this would only take minutes they want to start movie and they are waiting on me wow that first minutes really flew by japanese major now if you were wondering wow wonder what this dorky lower classmans major is you know feel bad that you have to read all this mental defecation ok what am thinking about now guess thinking about the way think and guess thats the point of this assignment congratulations usually think in words unless inebriated then think in pictures do not like thinking in pictures because things are so hard to communicate hmm this is starting to get old not to imply that short attention span but somehow pictured this differently thought about mapping all my thoughts about the previous thoughts on reality in general now decided that is just to strange to submit to some stranger no offense in the psych department whoever reading this should read the principia discordia and the illuminatus trilogy while telling you what to do you should vote for gore aww heres something can write about politics hate and fear george bush the fact that his slimy presence has to disgrace the great city of austin is quite the insult his christian pro life beliefs coupled with his yen for the death penalty confuse and aggravate me rue the day the christian right gain presidential power also am happy worked rue into that last sentence aww yeah well it looks like my writing time is coming to an end also played with the idea of getting hellasiously wasted before doing the stream of consciousness assignment glad didnt this paper is crazy and disjointed enough already ok well farewell random psych guy who read this will always hold special place in my heart to you well not really and that should relieve you promise you not crazy well no more than anyone else keep it real brother man
college is lot different that thought it would be things are not as simple as they use not be individuals on campus tend to be greatly deceiving in appearance and motives walking down jester see about five people at once trying to get me to join their particular club or organization man do not know if want to join sorority or not and if do not sure which one to join there are so many different ones with unique styles not to mention that would feel bad if do not at least go to the meetings mainly because my sister co founded the delta in houston but the one in austin is not the same in activities and purpose the ones at ut are mainly all about parties need to find out what we are all doing tonight if we go clubbing need to find out who all is driving and how getting everywhere hate this about austin no one really has car and it is so inconvenient to go out of course unless you find guy with car but doubt that will happen any time soon more importantly do not even want to find guy right now need to deal with getting use to college life and then need to just have fun guess so much more freedom here there is no one to enforce strict curfew or make you do anything everyone at ut is on their own and self reliant and self dependent although it might sound scary at first it is rush to have so much space to grow not only that but you meet people and they can impact your life in ways you would of never imagined and that is what love the most about this experience would contend that college life is definitely once in lifetime opportunity and grateful to have the chance cant wait until college really starts and get the hang of it all when things are new it takes while to get use to it but soon enough hope get the hang of it all the atmosphere here unlike any other ever been in and believe that is good thing change brings about bigger and better opportunities not to mention that my parents are not here the main reason that even decided to go to the university of texas is to be away from home need to me away from the usual drama of living at home the only thing here is that the penalty can be lot more serious for things you get in trouble for hope we do not in too much trouble for being at the wrong place at the wrong time on tuesday man if they call my parents will be in so much trouble it is not even funny they are going to kill me and then make me go back to the university of houston which swore would never do
when came to texas thought that school was going to be very difficult and that would not meet anyone new these are both wrong so far met many new people and feel as if school is not going to be as hard as had expected love my classes and the diversity of students in them diversity to some people is bad thing but love it think it is great to any environment to have people from every different ethnic or religious background my favorite band the dave matthews band has lead singer named dave matthews he is from south africa although he is caucasian he considers himself to be of south african background he sings many songs that talk about the problems with diversity in the world today and in years before he is great man and love his songs went to the concert in houston last night and watched the people around everyone seems to love him feel that he is my inspiration his songs have such meaning and feel that every song that he sings relates to me in some way during the concert he was so moved by his music that he would dance and play around on stage he is such an entertainer and performer that it would be impossible for anyone not to like him or his band each person on the band has unique talent boyd tinsley is the violinist and can play jams for hours at time he is very talented and used to have band of his own before he joined the dave matthews band leroi moore is the wind instrument player cannot really specify what instrument he plays because he plays over different instruments and all of which he plays to perfection during concerts he must where sunglasses because he is so shy that he closes his eyes during the entire time of which he is playing carter beauford is the drummer he is probably the most talented member of the band besides dave of course recently he was ranked the number one drummer in the world another member of the band is stefan lessard he plays the bass guitar for the band he joined the band in his junior year of high school he is the youngest member of the band finally dave matthews plays lead acoustic guitar for the band he is probably one of the most talented songwriters in the world today the band last year had the highest profit grossing summer tour which made over million dollars before dave started the band he used to bartend at local bar in virginia called millers this is important because he met all the members of the band bartending at that bar he ended up starting the band in and didnt get all the members to actually commit until every year the band becomes more popular and more popular but the initial reason why the band became so popular in the very beginning was because the band allowed fans to plug into the soundboard and create tapes these tapes where then copied and passed onto many other people and through this very system of tape trading the bands popularity grew at exponential rates nowadays people can just use napster to trade songs but back in the early nineties people actually had to trade the tapes in person or through the mail this band is my inspiration and hope that they will live forever in my mind and in the mind of the people who hears their music
just thinking about how different college is from high school ivent come home from going out every night until am and think my roommate is getting really upset with me feel bad because she never goes out and when tell her going out think she feels left out going to start inviting her we knew each other in high school and now were living together which is kind of weird but its working out really well people always told me not to room with my friend because you will end up hating each other but its been working so far she is one of those motherly typesshe likes cleaning and looking after meits fun just broke up with my boyfriend of years last weekend that was really tough because we were so close he does not go to ut so that was making it really difficult miss him dating this guy now that went to my high school but he graduated year earlier hes really cool and we get along but it is not the same well just see how it works out miss my family so used to seeing them everyday and now that do not its weird was so ready to get out of the house but now that officially out its sad feel so old to be independent which stinks when first got here my computer wasnt working so had to take it to the repair place and got it all set up by myselfit works nowobviously that was kind of liberating though doing something important by yourself was the kind of kid who never ordered by herself at the restaurant always had my mom do it so coming to college and figuring stuff out by myself is really weird ivent had much homework lately thought college was really tough and so far it really has not been my roommate has tons of homework every night and just havent feel like missing out on the college experience today going to college station to visit my friend we are going to see pat green in concert which will be totally awesome love pat green my roommate is going to the dave matthews concert in dallasim jealous she has been home every weekendthats probably not healthy her boyfriend is still back home so she misses him lot think she needs to stay here at least one weekend in between the times she goes home do not really think she is homesickjust bored austin is such great citypeople always told me that once you go to austin you wont want to leave can see how that can happen theres always something to do starting to run out of things to talk abouti think my minutes are almost over found somethingthe freshman not going to gain thatbut can definitely see how that happens you definitely have more spare time in college than we did in high school was really busy in high school was on drill team and had practice every night until didnt have much time to myself now do get bored my dad just got new car its weird that he has new car and never seen it my little sister had her th bday yesterday and she told my momwhen is sara coming home my mom said she lives three hours away she cant come home tonight because shell have to drive back for class the next day when my mom told me that started crying because it has not hit my little sister yet that moved out we used to not be close but we are nownow that we are growing up well my minutes are upits been nice talking to you
sometimes like stream of conscience writing because when write fictional or nonfictional stories that is usually the style of writing use used to write lot when was younger and planned on becoming writer stopped at about the th grade because that is when began to focus more on school think that middle schools and especially high schools place too much emphasis on grades those institutions should be places for students to want to learn but now its all competition and people care less about what they actually learn and get out of the class and care way too much about whether they get an in the class now that in college trying to start fresh and actually become passionate about the classes take whether they are required or not still have no idea what want to be when grow up besides movie star open for all sorts of things when applied to wanted to be big time advertising ceo but then decided that would be selling out too much within the last couple of months thought about dental school and becoming dentist but still do not know would really like to be movie star and plan to save up money and go to los angeles summers from now and just live on my own for the summer and audition for jobs know so many people go there and do stuff like that and still do not become famous ivent even taken theater arts class since the th grade do not think taking theater classes do much though unless one wants to be in theater but do not want to stage acting want to do films think in films to start out with all you need is little talent which think and good looking facebody which working on haha so thats my plan so far ivent told really anyone my best friend thinks that going with her to backpack in europe next summer but cant afford it at all plan on working at pool hall next summer so can make lot of money and save up for my next years apt and my famous trip would also like to take bus to new york sometime and live independently my brother danny did that few years ago and wrote in journal the whole time would love to get that kind of experience and keep it in journal should probably get journal now so can record my little experiences right now but so far nothing spectacular has happened thought that since freshmen in college id be meeting tons of new people and be going on billion crazy adventures but ivent at all most of the people at are from my high school at least one person from my high school in each class so its hard to branch out and meet new people also been stressing over money lately because to pay for everything books tuition housing myself and ivent had time to think about doing fun stuff just got wristband for the texasou game not that interested in football though like basketball lot and cant wait until ut basketball season starts though would like to make the most of my time in austin since its such beautiful and fun city but do not know when to start going to dallas this weekend so maybe next weekend ill hop on one of the buses and tour the city sometimes like not knowing where going just like to relax and look at all the things around me and see the sights of austin away from the campus and the tourist parts one day my sister and took the wrong bus and it went throughout the more ghettobarrio part of town it was real interesting to see the different people get on the bus we saw cute little boys around the ages of and and admired how independent they seemed for such young age they got on the bus not knowing where they wanted to go but just decided to go anywhere and overheard them say weve got hours where do yall want to go think mature compared to my peers at times because had dysfunctional family life growing up through high school though we moved into an upper class neighborhood and attended very affluent high school which sometimes felt like liberal outcast amongst bunch of conservatives some of the things people at my school would say about poor people really pissed me off but its been minutes so will finish up this was very cathartic should really invest in journal
been sitting in my room for the past four hours addicted to video game ivent studied ivent eaten ivent done anything except sit in front of my television screen and focus on my sega dreamcast the game is virtua tennis along with my roommates begun to form somewhat of an addiction to the game we play everyday and sometimes we play as late as in the morning we have played all sorts of different players from all over the world and it sometimes takes as long as two hours to beat the harder players sometimes wish could just take the game and throw it out the window it is starting to run my life and it is drawing me away from my studies every night when do get to sleep think about tennis over and over again in my head it is like disease that is eating away at my mind finally drew myself away from the game because starting to realize that my classes are important now beginning to focus more on my work luckily ivent been in school long enough for this game to do anything to my overall effectiveness in any class think the main reason was drawn away from the game is because along with my roommates after hours and hours of playing finally beat all the levels and achieved every goal we could possibly get out of the game this video game has turned me into lazier person than ever been and it makes it harder for me to concentrate on my studies must get rid of this game before it messes with my academics therefore going to the store sometime soon to return the game or at least exchange it for something much less addicting by doing this feel can better focus on my class work and devote more time and effort to studying and making good grade in all of my classes
today woke up really late and had to run to class which made me tired my math class is so easy do not even know why in it well actually do its because in this fig and that is pretty cool it helps lot do not know what exactly supposed to write but trying to just keep going know that happy today because my girl friend ginger is coming to town and ivent seen her in week that also includes my mother really miss her and know that she is lonely also miss my brother and sister and even my dad wish could play video games and party with my brother like we used to before left speaking of partying ivent done any of that since came to austin which is supposedly this huge party city think the reason that ivent partied is because not been able to meet many guys here yet and that is usually who go party with also miss my party pals from arlington they were not my best friends but they were blast to go party with wonder how they are doing right now think they are probably skipping class for no reason again do not know why you would skip class in high school it just gets you into too much trouble never got in trouble in high school until the last day when me and lot of senior guys rode our bikes up to school and then through the school that got us dhall but it was worth it because the bike thing was really fun in fact all of high school was really fun except no all of it was fun it was easy there was always party and had group of good friends to hang out with which made it even better those kids who are still there do not know how lucky they are to still be there mean love college and everything but it is just way different and living by yourself is not all its cracked up to be mean to clean my room do my own laundry and stuff like that also think that had good morals installed in me because feel really bad when party in my room which thought would do all of the time but guess that also has to do with my roommate he is just fresh in from india and is not that accustomed to living in america yet but he is lot cooler than thought he was once sat down and talked to him guess if you give people chance most of them come through except for the real jerks listening to prodigy right now and it is really fun to listen to fell like writing down what it sounds like but since it is techno it would broadly be difficult for me to accomplish that wish that had the musical talent and equipment to do something like that but neither the time or musical capacity to really do that
ok try not to think just let all your thoughts come together this is not as easy as thought it was going to be the guy next door is still playing that crappie music wish could go one day without hearing that but think its ok my roommate just walked in and started to talk to me so lost my train of thought alright he left glad mary his girlfriend is going home hope they do not walk back in here and see what just wrote but is suck last night hearing them makeout when was trying to sleep but shes cool my hands are getting tried of typing do not know if can make it the whole min now hes playing new song but he turned it off thank god we need to clean up this place is nasty do not know if going to be able to get eric to clean the bathroom is nasty run out of things to say and write eric has some gay sunglass hope he does not wear them around me hope just didnt offend my teacher or who ever reads this by saying gay hope my teacher does not think now think hes gay not that theres anything wrong with that thats like that episode of sinfied do not think spelled that right do not have time to change it just more minutes didnt write that much hope still get good grade just slow typer time is almost up need something to do after this ill call dan well maybe not do not want him to think no other friends
sitting in my room at the towers and to admitt that the room size is not half bad ecspecially compared to my older sisters dorm room when she was freshman however do have one complaint and that is that the room are not taken care of in the least bit and if had to approximate the last time this place was renovated my honest guess would be nineteen ninetyone yet can live with rather filthy room but the worst part about living in the towers has to be the food the cooks here should go down in the guiness book of world records for being the first people ever to make chicken taste bad and everytime go in there seem to be asking the cook what exactly the food sitting in front of me is which through my experience translates into something that is not good thing as look around my room cant help but notice the fact that my side is far more messy than my roomates but to be honest this is no concern of mine because he eats all of my food went pot luck in the towers for my roomates which means that my rooming assignment is totally random ivent really decided what my true feelings about my new roomates are due to the fact that we havent really spent time together this fact is more my fault than it is theirs because for one thing in pledgeship right now so finding time to spend with people is like finding needle in haystack but every once in while do get to spend little time with them and from those few experiences can say that tony the guy with whom share room with is very nice person and believe that we will get along very well so far the one thing that has kind of tied us together is that fact that we have the same taste in music which is major relief to me my other two roomates who live across the living room from me are both going through pledge ship and campbell has been really nice as well though he seems rather reserved yet the one guy that not to fond of at this time is my third roomate joey its not that there is hostility between us its just that try to be as nice as possible to him and try to start conversations with him every time get yet he just wont seem to respond maybe its just difference in the way we were brought up or something because know when was in high school this new guy moved in from chicago and he really kept to himself along with his parents but the more time spent with him the more he opened up and now we are really good friends but the funny thing is that all of the football parents thought that his parents were rud because they didnt really talk whole lot and had to remind my mom that thats how people are in chicago and just to give them time because they are really good people

for some reason been feeling really tired lately been getting plenty of sleep but its been hard falling asleep it feels like there have been million random thoughts running through my head recently ivent been able to understand many of them or why think them in the first place sometimes feel like add ever since stopped smoking marijuana my grades havent been what expect of myself and my motivation just has not been there for anything my mom persistently assures me that do not have it but just want to get tested so know before moved off to college couldnt stand being at my house for more than an hour at time but now want to be there all the time even though cant know that many kids feel depressed right after they move off to college but do not feel like anyone is going through what never understand myself one minute miss my exgirlfriend was the one that broke up with her but why do miss her so much went home last weekend an ran into her right after left understood why broke up with her but already back to thinking why broke up with her do not always understand her either sometimes feel that its her clinical depression that makes her that way but other times feel like it was always me remember hearing the phrase theres someone for everyone well if thats true whos my someone hate waiting around and just want someone that can count on being there guess thats why decided to break up with her in the first place never felt that could count on her always being there for me my dad told me that my grandfather was an alcoholic so does that mean that there is good chance that will be one too wish things were the way they were before last summer when had girlfriend and had my friends that were there for me understand that college is all about experiencing new things and meeting new people but really havent had the urge to do either of the two maybe this is just phase that everyone goes through hope so had no will to meet any new girls which expected the complete opposite before leaving if miss my home and my parents so much then why do never have the will to call them and just talk why can not just gain little weight no matter how much eat cant gain pound know these are supposed to be the best years of my life so when do start counting love math and everything but it just seems like there is something out there that would rather be doing instead of mechanical engineering
sitting in my dorm room right now and just thought it would be good idea to go ahead and do my psychology homework because do not have anything to do and there does not seem to be anything interesting on tv was so stressed out earlier today because can not hack it in my calc class went to class though only to affirm what had previously believed yeah right used to think was pretty smart but being in that class made me see that not going to be able to excell in math or the college of natural sciences for that matter simply for the fact that math is required actually happier though because now eliminated one course of studies and narrowed my choices like that like feeling little more directed with college and the future leaning towards transfering to the college of communications also added rtf to my schedule so excited for it people annoy the crap out of me sometimes wish could just crawl into box and never come out call me crab but do not really care what feel chubby right now want to eat but then do not know the consequences of putting food in my mouth when do not truly want it wasters never want good quote very true come so far in my life cant believe finally at college on my own there are so many things to be thankful for in my life and in so many ways lucky it is hard to keep clear perspective all of the time that is the problem with being human we are always failing falling short of the glory of god it is so much more difficult to loose weight for the second time lost muscle and gained fat and now it takes longer and also have more fat cells that will naturally hold on to the chubbs will keep working on consistency and the important thing is to be persistant cant believe used to sell knives this summer seems like years ago but it was actually just aboout ago one day hope there is an invention to where you can eat and eat and eat and it wouldnt matter at all would pay good money for that sure every woman in the would do the same bet my skin has lot of sun damage tan too often but do like the feeling and not going to stop
just sitting here in my dorm room wondering what exactly supposed to do on this assignment will the professor scold me for writing the incorrect responses not sure can hear things right now one in my air conditioner it sounds like small fast moving fan fast moving fan that does not seem to cool the room at all can also hear the neighbors music through the wall now that think of it can hear the soft hum of my computer as well looking at an award thats hanging on my wall earned playing tennis for my high school now thinking about my high school friends steph bree ki ashley james niko john and kenton were my closest friends miss them but so excited about my new life ryan was my good friend in high school too but guess didnt include him in that list because hes my roomate was going to try and not mention annie but thats really who thinking about met annie at camp texas about week before school shes really wonderful person that very attracted too looking at charlie brown pez dispencer that she gave to me yesterday now staring into my computer with because it has large plexiglass window on the side its quite distracting really jumble of customly installed wires is to me something like low rider car to another person now see router that going to use to hook up our network when we get road runner installed in our dorm room took years of networking class in high school and after the first sememster was convinced that was what wanted to spend my life doing however recently decided that networking wasnt my true aspiration so do not really know what want to do specifically told thats okay and will figure it out soon enough and beleive it think getting kind of sick so took some medicine earlier and have bad taste in my mouth from the medicine now thinking should go work out tomorrow at gregory my friend told me that theres another good gym near gregory but there arent as many girls there now wondering what going to write about for my last minutes really have no clue could explain how put my computer together or what each part does could talk about my high school tennis experiences about my family or about my high school hobbies my roomate has arrived and greeted him he went to his bed and is watching tv some sort of sports sure we went to the football game last saturday ut won ut scored all points in the first half so the second half was pretty boring it was still better than expected for my first college football game really want to go see the ou game this year but tickets are hot commodity after this assignment going to try to do some economics and maybe calculus this class psychology is the class most worried about this semester took calculus in high school and think with little studying ill be able to make in it do not know why but great understanding for economics so do not think that class will be incredibly hard either my communications teacher said that her class would be hard but think better at communications that psychology also have ba and freshman interest group class but those are pretty much participation grades so little time effort will ensure an my schedule is incredible none of my classes start before and fridays off from school find upperclassmen drooling over this schedule so to find it as freshman is pretty incredible think as my time winds down wonder what exactly this class has in store for me even college heck even life wonder what big decisions will make what lucky breaks will get what major crises will encounter and what disadvantages will overcome all can do is wish myself and my fellow peers luck and great success to find what we truly desire

sit here in my dorm room really tired probably because stayed up late doing homework last night my body feels sore but like to workout so that does not really bother me much can not really concentrate right now but that is probably because just woke up and still feel half asleep feel very stressed out right now because chemistry exam on friday and need to read to the chapters guess should not have procrastinated but do that lot my roommate is actually going to class for once and very happy for her hurray thought this assignment was going to be lot easier than it is but guess not really thirsty right now my hair has gotten really long and very happy about that because cut it all off recently but it is growing back my knee really hurts because out in the hot sun but then go in the freezing classroom so whenever there is temperature change my knee aches my junior year in high school tore my acl and had reconstructive surgery so screws in it my roommate just left and it is so hard to do anything around here because she just keeps talking to me even when it is obvious busy how annoying and she uses my computer all of the time to talk to her boyfriend and it is my computer like when got on to do this paper she wrote that she had to go and she was sorry but hopefully would be quick about it wanted to tell her something so bad but we have to live together for year and do not want to make it living hell do not know how to approach the situation with out us hating each other but if this keeps on will end up hating her living with girls sucks because we are all so petty skipped my calculus discussion this morning but it is my only class on tuesdays and thursdays and it had to be at in rlm which is so far and hate that building well my time is just about up and really excited because tired of typing
well start typing now so do not really know my computer stopped making the fan noise why does it do that the simpsons are on next door could watch that but stuck doing this oh well what is that oh yeah like that full even though the food is not good its all you can ear love all you can eat well since do not really know what to talk about can just write about things that my phone rang can answer it do not think so oh well ill call them back hope it was not jb calling about the hell raiser meeting damn oh but can write bout things do not really talk to other people bout like when left didnt really expect robyn and to last really although wanted to and but now it is not really that hard and love her but kinda find myself wishing it was harder so that could hav an excuse if needed one to get out but differing opinions on it mostly cause one moment miss her and jus want to hang out with her but the next get annoyed that to talk to her and when other girls talk to me here feel like shouldnt even though there is no reason not to and robyn wouldnt even care the slightest cause she is so understanding and this is why our whole thing is not that hard cause she makes it easy thats the main reason stayed with her cause usually do not have relationships ever this is mainly my first and definitely my first serious one which is another thing sometimes it seems so serious like back off but when she acts casual want her to act more serious guess the whole thing is stupid and shouldnt worry bout it cause easy going and should let things go with the flow going to call dusting when done so can see if he is going to the hell raisers wow it is quiet in here with no music want to turn on ole kenny but ill wait min left this is going by fast thought was barely talking wish knew her name talk to her everyday and she is in of my classes and she introduces me to people and do not even know her name thats kinda fucked up but could like seinfeld introduce someone and she has to say her name that would work wonder when seinfeld comes on its not like it matters though all really do anymore is read and study quiet it is never this quiet my shoulder feels weird my phone is ringing again brb oh talking to jb about hell raisers that was easy going to his room in well sec so can wait no well now but yeah think going to work out after the meeting wonder if they let anyone in that show is on hear the theme song my computer sounds weird man guy that robyn knows or knew shot himself in the face last night it was sad supposedly he was mad or something and his gf was fighting with him and he shot himself in the face with pistol right in front of her robyn felt bad but didnt know what to say really cause she has not seen him or talked to him in long time so to me it wouldnt have been that big of deal this is getting long now that looking forward ahead in the direction of thinking of ways to say that differently alternately substitute words my eyes are getting tired not blinking need to ok wow that burned shut them for like sec and it burned it is better now jonathan thought he broke his toe and skarke got so wasted it was funny burped and hiccupped at the same time wonder what this is going to say about me do not really care though cause think most of psy is just unnecessary over evaluation but it is interesting on lot of levels the lie detector was cool though think could beat it maybe but well thats all

window is just above my bed cant see the stars but the lights of the city substitute nicely wish my bed were higher so could lay in it and look out the window over the city this is the one place that feel on top of the world even though lately my world has been crumbling down see the cars going by some steadily others as though they were racing and the last remind me of my drum major in high school who used to yell at us for lollygagging imagine they are going to exciting places places where they do not worry if their boyfriend is cheating on them or why they cant seem to motivate themselves to do the assigned readings for class pretend for them make them my social group named the girl who sits on the wall outside dobie lisa think its nice name she is always out there to smoke cigarettes imagine because her roommate is the type that is anal and cant stand to have the rules bent much less broken lisa hates that that is why she wears shorts sizes to small that make her legs dimple while she is perched atop the wall lonely when look out my window feel like everyone else is too we are disjointed people connected by this city these lights and sounds that are the stuff of civilization sure someone else is in that blue building with the steplike structure sitting somewhere looking out feeling the same as me like it when it rains when the sky is heavy and dark and sad wish it would rain here never seen that from my window think that might like to live in tall building like this later on in life but would have to live there alone its hard to bask in my emotions while my roommate debates who loves who more with her feminine boyfriend before they discuss what theyre going to do for their umpteenth month anniversary my suitemate fits me better feel how she acts but cant express myself that way for too many reasons one very big one being my excessively religious parents they would flip no one understands my thoughts care so much more about the whys than the what is but act the opposite wish could do nothing but read all day id go in the living room in the pappazan or however you spell it chair by the window in therebut it would have to be higher tooto see out the window that is what connects me keeps me here keeps me from floating away so would sit there and would read would go all sorts of places and be all sorts of people but my window would be my anchor as sailed through these many parallel universes think my favorite would be in jane austen novel theyre so warm theres such sense of how to act without ever having to think wish didnt think try to keep myself so busy that do not but my mind wont be constrained its only controlled by the window my looking glass sanctuary its solitude without loneliness feel the most lonely with lots of people on the south mall at noon walking to class so many people with such well put together lives purposeful strides and slender hips watch them behind tree wear long skirts to cover what wish wasnt there with my thick dark hair pulled back tugging on my wrinkled shirt that wont ever stay into place magic though powers can be invisible no one ever knows that there no one ever knows at my window with its menagerie of colored lights do not know about anything anymore wish someone would just tell me what supposed to do that there was some fated order of things that would be easy to accept that is why we have religion it gives you all the whys and leaves you only the what is but for some of us that wont suffice no doctrine will halt the whys of my mind will always wonder about it if not the things it claims confused and lonely and at my window it does not make sense but tomorrow ill get up and ill go to class ill say hi to all my friends and smile the weird thing is ill even enjoy it and be distracted so that only focus on the what is ill watch tv and do homework and probably even go to club with the cute guy cant ever date because he happens to be my untrustworthy boyfriends cousin yes there are so many problems but then ill go to bed ill lie and look out the pane that sensitizes me to my pain and ill think about all the whys of my life and how ill probably never figure them out just how to distract myself from them

bit past pm on sunday and only just woke up while ago so here writing psychology paper which has no definite topic as such usually listen to laid back electronictype music when do papers which is what doing now feel it helps me free up my mind and help me think more clearly do not know how this paper is going to end up or whether writing what supposed to but suppose thats the point of the exercise so tracking my thoughts well first off just realized how annoying the timer at the top of the page is watching it tick away while thinking of something to write which shouldnt be problem anyway since supposed to write what thinking and not the other way around just seems to get on my nerves bit wonder what the rest of the writing assignments this semester will be like though they need to fix this page up though it didnt work in my primary web browser mozilla firefox and do not like internet explorer all that much oh the music just changed its bit faster and slightly more aggressive now got myself some candy too though probably shouldnt have since ill be having lunch in bit its getting bit warmer in here someone probably increased the air conditioner temperature again and now my roommate is playing basketball outside in the living room one of these days think hes going to break something minutes and the clocks ticking really should get some work done today pretty much wasted the last two days but hey what are three day weekends for got some math and cs homework as well as freshman seminar paper maths an interesting class even if it is too easy not to sound self deluded but do think know more calculus than most people in that class at least so far computer science is different story though the class is bit harder than expected it to be but nothing beyond me little googling and should easily be able to look up anything do not already know and complete the assignment java is not really one of my strengths but that does not mean cant make it one like psychology though at first thought it would be impersonal and intimidating because of the sheer number of students in it but thats changed minutes just have to continuously keep looking at the timer and the music just stepped up now its bit faster than before and actually got this paper done so proud of myself well not really but glad got it done anyway and now my minds blank really looks like my times up did mention hate popups time to click the finish button
love my girlfriend leah she is so awesome love her big butt and her hair love her tongue and her smile man oh man does she give good hand jobs almost as good as sex almost there are some things do not like about her though she is tiny bit chubby but it does not really bother me that much she is stubborn and that at times gets on my nerves also worry that she is shopaholic and that if we do get married one day that she will spend too much of our income wonder what will be doing years from now it would be so awesome to be country music station radio dj think the prime time for me would have to be like at lunch time believe that would be best cause then could stay up late still and sleep in little later the rush hour traffic time would be awesome too would have fun being the dj in the morning but would hate the hours mean whoa not my kind of lifestyle also wonder if being personal trainer is going to work out ivent been really an active gym goer need to start doing that trying to think of what would be good time to go on mondays could go right after class at same thing goes for wednesdays on tuesdays thursdays and fridays should probably go right after spanish because then after done could go eat something that would probably kill two birds with one stone because of the fact that wouldnt have to eat before go to spanish then could probably focus on cardio type stuff on monday wednesday and friday and then weight train on tuesday and thursday maybe should do the opposite cause then could work my muscles more and they do say lose weight by working out plus on mondays and wednesdays it will be harder to do cardio at that time since it will be so crowded at that time now about tennis really hope can get to play on the real courts and not have to go to intermural courts just to practice should go check that out tomorrow along with all the other things need to do it would be cool if leah and sara came to ut next year unfortunetly do not see that happening when it comes to leah wonder how long should wait before proposing think waiting til at least my junior year would be best because then at least my parents will see that we are in serious relationship mean two years is long time to be with someone and it was about that same time amber and jeff were together no wait they were actually years think maybe when he asked and before marriage do not know whatever it is the only question is that when we are married what will we first do for money could probably go back to heb cause mean they do not pay that poorly possibly even be ccm or something so that could bring little extra dough in would try hard to at least get job at radio station wonder how long have to work at one before they give your own show should also go to the radio station tomorrow to see if could get some kind of spot in there even if it wasnt show but technical thing okay so when it comes to homework what should do so that somewhat of schedule if sleep in the mornings or at least plan to do not think should try scheduling that in what should probably try to do is try to be strict to making sure get hw done first before do anything else because then could go to sleep sooner too and then maybe this job wouldnt be too bad cause thats probably my problem the fact that do not go to sleep early enough want to go to midnight rodeo this saturday just wish roger creager wasnt playing there remember to call leah tomorrow to tell her mom about staying out later back to study monday and wednesdays should be too bad hw wise becuase all is my writing class easy and spanish so getting out late on those days is not too bad tuesdays and thursdays should try to make sure done with hw by like cause then could go eat after did my hw thats pretty good plan only on occasions should change that up what mean by that is like being invited to do stuff never let it be online poker or tv that distracts me that includes playing xbox even if think had hard day so far just think how more satisfying that resting will be once everything done mean knowing do not have anything left to do is nice feeling this writing this is going by faster than thought didnt know had all this stuff on my mind think it would be nice to have pac on my body and some muscle you know it really does kind of upset me that leah does not want me hanging out with females alone find that it shouldnt matter mean on one hand know her past and do not want to upset her on something as small as this but on the other hand it is kind of big deal maybe should talk with her again and we could go more in depth or even set up some ground rules about this hopefully we can compromise kind of tired but really do need to study for spanish quizzes tomorrow and should look over chapter for this class wonder when the first test is think it is on the th thats coming up pretty soon should look at that handbook thing on sample test questions on this friday along with that could reread philosophy and study some more spanish and go to seminar for writing class this was kind of fun thing to do kind of like having diary like this helps me think clearly
feel well at all wonder if it was the tequila from last night or worrying about girl sometimes do not know why still with her can you still have feelings for someone that you find annoying why am doing this writing assignment now my stomach and head are killing me should have tried to pawn it off on one of my roommates for ten dollars or something because who wants to right about what they think more interested in what other people think about mean alrdy know what think about its boring to me what about the people do not know what do they think about thats what want to know know that girl down there is thinking about something some psycologist needs to figure out how to read girls thats what they should be working on why learn about depression figure out what girls think about honestly do not think single man can tell me what girl is thinking at any given time half the time they hate you other half they love you and it can switch just as fast whats the deal with that still feeling bad my stomach wont stop hurting think need to get something to eat need to get feeling better cause already have plans for tonight and it sucks going out when you do not feel well when go out and do not feel well get extremely annoyed with everyone that with its probably because they are having more fun then noticed that school is obsessed with talking about politics in every class go to we talk about bush and kerry yes more minutes to go on the assignment but too much politics in my opinion half the time it has no correlation with the subject at hand in my spanish class we had minute discussion about economic poilices how does that help me with hola como estas this assignment is not bad its like the people that have journals who put there mind on paper
really cold in my room my roommate likes it that way and for some unknown reason it is lot colder in our room than it is in the rest of the apartment so we walk around and it is hot and then we come into our room and it is freezing awesome hope can make to class on time today cause writing for minutes might put me little late oh well it is history and usually do not go anyway and why is that why is it that some people are extremely motivated to do well and make the good grades whereas there are people like me who could honestly care less is it the parents doubt that cause mine are extremely motivated wearing jeans and boots today and my roommate told me that it was wierd cause do not look so goofy my mouse just messed up if can make it through this whole writing assignment without losing my wireless internet connection will be extremely impressed sad huh anyways really want to go to arkansas this weekend for the game one of these years going to get ticket to every texas gamand go although this would be the year cause they really do not have any games that are that far away my roommate took psycology last year did spell that right anyways do not think he had to do anything like this need to call my mom havent talked to her in few days she likes it whenever call do call home whole lot more than the rest of the guys know such mammas boy really like the shirt that wearing lime green some say gay say nice yeah really nice man this is starting to get hard and only been writing for minutes do not know if thought for minutes straight in my whole life really do not my brain just shuts off and space out especially during class sometimes wonder if that add crap always been told that do but since made good grades in school they never took me to go get evaluated or anything like that school the only thing miss about high school is football that was my life coach always said it would be the best time ever had but never believed him until was done playing and trust me it was mean lot of fun in college meeting new people and getting drunk all the time but really miss playing ball this damn song my roommate plays the same songs all the time never good songs and yet he plays the same ones over and over again hold on to write for psyc be there in minutes he wants me to read something for him coke love coke for some reason not that is tastes good cause really do not think the taste is good at all and yet drink it all the time like it is an addictive taste addictive think very addictive personality if there is such thing like snuff never would have thought that would start having cravings for snuff and yet do like right now where did put my can oh man this sucks cant find it can wait untill get done only more minutes hands are starting to get little tired of doing this had dream last night and think in it called my exgirlfriend sometimes dreams with her in them and do not know why its wierd do not really care for her or anything just sometimes she is in my dreams speaking of dreams could use nap right about now man slept till and am still tired whatever happened to that this is the guy who would get up to go to the weight room everymorning in high school and come to college and now getting up is early that is like and half hours lateri could quite possibly be the laziest person on this earth just might be actually they could conduct study and think would be the laziest except for all the homeless people twice in row he has the song on repeat how in the hell could somebody listen to the same song twice in row ok got to say something not again do not even like this song he put on now ok this one is not bad more minute cramp in the forearm am going to make tat fica plant looks it really good really hope you do not look into as long as submit it is very hard more seconds cant wait done
ok so just got back from four hour study hour thing at the zta house wow the most pointless thing ever read maybe pages how am supposed to study with other girls there in the room you do not have that much space and of course you want to talk about what happened last night and who ended up where and blahblahblah know they have good intentions in making us do this but hours at one time is waaay too long to try to study no one really got anything done but hey it was fun got to bond more with my sorority sisters speaking of sorority stuff love it at first was afraid wouldnt like it or that the girls wouldnt like me but couldnt be having more fun more friends than thought would have going into college and theyre real friends too not friends you pay for with sorority fees listening to music right now and recently as in the past couple of months gotten more and more into music always loved music but ever since dated great guy who is complete music person liked it even more today kyle and my aggie exboyfriend were joking about how pathetic we are for missing eachother so much it was funny we knew going into it at the beginning of the summer that we were going to break up when we went off to college because of course it wouldnt work but now that were all settled in we still miss eachother it got really serious really fast it was unbelievably random we never thought we would hookup but it happened and it was awesome hate to say it because so young and hate it when people say things like that but could quite possibly see myself with him after college like permanently thats so weird well sincewe did break up we are allowed to hang out with other people datewise but neither of us really wanted to last week met this really cool guy from the woodlandshes an ato pledge gone to couple parties with him as his date and kind of have crush on him its exciting but at the same time far from being over kyle the whole point of not being together was that we could go out and have fun without being tied down but still feel bad about it constantly had this entire soap opera on my mind for the last week nonstop the cool thing about being in relationship is that you have that stability you never have to wonder if he likes you or if hes going to call and all that with new guy its always like wonder if he likes me and why didnt he callworrying its fun do not get me wrong but it kind of puts ur confidence in check recently gotten into maroon again used to love them but working at hollister and hearing the entire cd all the time made me hate it do not work at hollister anymore so ivent heard maroon in awhile and now love them again
