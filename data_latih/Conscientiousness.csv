ok i guess i really dont know where to start i just got out of my ba class which was possibly the single most boring experience thus so far since classes began i guess maybe i should have stayed longer but there were so many freshman around me with their eyes so wide open and trying to make friends with everyone around them that i couldnt stand it for very much longer this screen is really bothering me because it seems as though i’m writing all of this on one very long line i am wondering if there is some way i can go about fixing it after this is all over because it is really annoying and it seems as though i am not writing anything i dont know what i am going to do tonight it is too late to call my boyfriend he lives overseas and there is a seven hour time change i hope everything is going well with hi am because he is going into his obligatory military service soon and he is really nervous about it if only i was still in france that way i would know that everything was going well with hi am this is a really huge box that i am writing in because the wrap around just came into affect very strange very very strange i guess i am at a point where i dont exactly know what to write about because my mind is kind of going blank my friend once told me that he never stops thinking that at all times he is thinking about something and when you are talking to hi am that he may or may not be thinking about the subject that you are talking about with hi am that worries me because sometimes i see i’m smile for no apparent reason when we are talking and i just know that the last thirty words that i have just said he is paying absolutely no attention to my friends are kind of strange in that they are all in their own little worlds thats not saying that i am not but my little world seems a little bit more down to earth then the ones that my friends are living in maybe thats why i am taking psych instead of sociology it is because i’m trying to figure out who these people are and why i chose them as my friends it could be an extension off this whole existential kick hat ive recently gotten into my boyfriend is really into existentialism and so the only thing ive been reading as of late has been kundera and sartre but then of course i must be honest i am taking this course because it is located close to my other class on tuesday thursday and it is at a convenient time relative to that class as well not to mention my friends who have taken soc told me it was echelons more boring than this class was to take i hope i get a good grade in this class after this last semester my grades are suffering i literally dropped my gpa by over this last summer semester which should indicate that i really didnt do very well but i only have hours so if i do well this semester i can bring my gpa back up over and maybe my parents will start being nice to me again it is not like they arent nice now but they are really disappointed how i handled last semester that is considering that we sent you to france last you you could at least try a little harder this would all be said in the james earl jones low god-like voice that i always get in my head whenever my dad is yelling at me i probably get that in my head because my dad yelling at me reminds me of darth vader when hes mad at the corporals and james earl jones is the voice of darth vader do you see the connection anyway so i am trying to make my grades appear somewhat better because if i do they will probably let me go on the intensive french study program i want to go to next summer and then i can see my boyfriend he is so cute i miss hi am a lot i tend to think about hi am most when i am either lonely or bored in class that only either maker me more distracted from the work i should be doing or even sadder about being all alone if only he could be american my life would be so much si ampler have i been writing for twenty minutes yet i swear ive been writing for decades and my hands are starting to get lazy and tired and i really dont want all these people around me in the computer room and i wish that i had had the time to take a shower this morning because i think all day in the sun has really made me start to smell i have to have been writing for over twenty minutes now because the people at the workstations around me have already started leaving granted they were here before i even started this little assignment into the mind of the student at the university of texas i am starting to think i am going to end this pretty soon because that is the only thing i can think of right now is when am i going to end this assignment i think this would probably be a good time because this is starting to redundant but you said that it didnt matter what we said as long a s we did the assignment and wrote for twenty minutes so here i am my twenty minutes complete and i am saying good bye and thank god this is over only one more to go
class lasted all day today on tuesdays and thursdays i have class from is to early is to late i like earlier classes it is easy to concentrate in the mornings i worked out today i think i hurt my elbow there is alot of pain in the joint i have been lifting weights for a long time maybe that has something to do with it lost pounds today i now way lbs my mother thinks i grew another inch i don’t know maybe this typing is really bothering my elbow damm thing really hurts i think i am going to take some aspirin ive got a biology test in two weeks lots of studying to do first test should not be so bad just a review of chemistry the class moves pretty fast but the professor is pretty good the seats in that class are way to close together i am aboutmaybe a little more and my knees push right up against the backs of the chairs it makes it hard to concentrate after about min all my other classes the chairs are pretty comfortable i hope we beat ucla on sat i hope the d defense can hold ji ammy hicks under yards james brown might not play but watson is a good back up ricky will have a great day and will kick ass
last night i had another fight with my mother maybe it was not such a good idea to stay home for my first year of college as far as i can see i have only brought her pain and no comfort although she does make several good points about my unorthodox behavior ulti amately i am a grown man if i told my friends that she tries to make me come home at a certain time the result would be ridiculous not that opinions and thought of my buddies would really sway my mind but many of them respect me for where i came from and what i have done ive got a good jobinsurance company hour pay for my car attend college help my mom at her beauty salon and still have time to go out and party with them my mother thinks that my constant ventures to places she has never been will bring about my demise certainly there is no way i can deny about her role in my life she has always been there for me and lately we have grown even closer but i don’t see how she can try and write my schedule out for me according to her opinions recently our dog had puppies and she spent much of the time caring for them and taking them to the vet six of the puppies have been sold and the one that is left originally belonged to the mail dogs owner who changed their mind about keeping it so my mom blames me for not cleaning up after the puppy i don’t even want i tell her to give it away and then she blames for being a cruel person in that we don’t know what kind of person would get it for a while now i have been looking for a female and i don’t mean just any ol girl i can get plenty of those but a lady who i wont get tired of after the first night in bed there is several ladies out there who i would like to be with but for some reason it never turns out to be the way i thought so i just go on with flirting around most girls i know think that i except something from them but i am si amply trying to be friends i guess that’s the rep i got at anderson high maybe because of the people i hang with hopefully ive written enough and if not here are some more of my thoughts for the prof to analyze in college ive tried to have different study habit is then high school in high school i could do nearly nothing and still maintain a high average here i know this can not be done this of course another concern of my mother i can not dismiss actual reading and studying as not i amportant at the university of texas or i might end up with a poor man working for mcdonalds’s or begging for money on the drag a few days ago i read in the psychology book that in order for your mind to expand you must exercise it like a muscle interesting idea
i really want to go swimming but i dont want to tell sylvia that i dont want to see her dumb brother play in that stupid baseball game i really want to go home this weekend i know for a fact that my mom would never let me go well maybe she would let me go out with gera even after i have not seen her for a while maybe i just dont want to go out with hi am i think that i feel guilty for some strange reason and i cant get the courage to tell gera this air conditioner is really bothering me it makes so much noise and does not cool very much i am so hungry my roommate sucks i dont know why i am so mean maybe i am just not used to someone always wanting to know everything i do maybe shes just too smart and i feel stupid i am really hungry i dont know how i am going to get to eat if i go with sylvia and loni i wonder if gera is calling me right at this moment i wonder how come his dad didnt say goodbye before hanging up i think i am making too much noise typing i get the feeling that i am disturbing everyone behind me i cant believe loni she just met this guy today and she already has hi am in her room i wonder if her parents know the way she is i still have one more question to do for economics and i dont really feel like reading i learned that i should wait to be told what to read before i stress that stress test sylvia and i took was weird i think that man thought that my life was pretty boring i bet he thought i was weird he could right away tell what was bothering sylvia i know that manny really has sylvia thinking about hi am day and night hes such a jerk i cant believe what how could someone treat someone that way maybe love is blind i wonder why people around here are so free i cant believe that girl i say two days ago she was wearing next to nothing and felt no shame i assume she must have felt fresh or something but doesnt she have one bit of self respect for herself i wonder why the lady behind me just apologized to the girl i had to turn around for a second i think that i am a nosy person i often catch myself eavesdropping on other peoples conversations during lunch today i listened to two complete conversations i could not believe the things that people talk about why does my roommate have to be so selfish i think that i want to make everyone healthy i dont know why but i am so self conscience of the way i look but i hear that is actually average in girls my age i went all out on this diet until i lost up to pounds and now i think that i am too skinny but i say this girl today that was a bit over weight and she was beautiful then why do i gross myself out when i see my roommate eating horrible and then i see her change and i feel that i have to go workout she gets offended very easily i dont even tell her anything about her weight or anything related to that subject anyway and she jumps up and becomes aggravated very quickly
my roommate is trying to ask me what we are going to do while i am typing this we played basketball for about two and a half hours for some reason i played pretty good today i usually dont play that good i am not really sure what to write well i mean type i went to a sorority date dash last night it was pretty fun they rented out some club on sixth street i saw some people that i went to highschool with and i didnt get home until about three so i am really tired i really doubt that ill stay out that late tonight tomorrow i am going to san antonio for the beastie boys concert with these girls that i dont really know that well i hope everyone has a good time the next day is my grandpas birthday and my entire family is going to meet at our ranch in gonzales that reminds me i have to get hi am a gift ill get hi am something from ut of course probably a hat or something my suitemates went home this weekend one lives in arlington the other lives in deer park they are pretty cool guys sometimes they get on my nerves but i am sure i get on peoples nerves too my roommate is going to a church thing right now he said that the people there are really nice but they are extremist about how they worship i think it makes hi am feel uncomfortable i can relate ive been to some church functions like that but he is also going because he met some girl there so he is getting the best of both worlds learning about god and hooking up with a girl i wish i could of gone i can hear my neighbors radio through my wall incase you wanted to know it kind of makes me want to turn mine on since my time with you is up
in this short amount of time i changed from a kid who major worries were only about hi am self i feel that i have really grow up i believe it was all the time that i got screwed over by my so called friends the first time was a the first of my senior year well i meet this guy named kurt and he was from indian and we shared common interest however he was new in town and did not have a girl friend however i was dating this one girl for about year well this girl was very possessive and very wealthy not to forget she was beautiful during the summer i worked as a life guard and taught swimming lesson in the mornings at her housemade tons of money any her family and her left for europe and had me house sit no problem making money had a garage full of tool to work on my cars and basically had my own house i had not friends because they all graduated a year earlier and cara had been my only friend this past year partially because she was so possessive well i meet kurt at the end of the summer and became good friends he was going to start school with us in the fall and everything was great until cara got home and said not more kurt she did the same thing with an early friend kc however i finally told her either she relaxes or we break up decision help by kurt so we broke up so i was dating again before cara i had a new girl friend every two days kurt and i were dating these two girl casi and lorine well lorine and kurt started dating and the only thing between casi and i was a physical thing so once i stop see her lorine influence kurt in stop hanging out with me five months down the road i have and new group of friend they a grade younger than me they have not had as much luck with the girls as i have so i am letting them meet some of my friends from out of town were a very tight group for about two months when one of the guy in the group named justin thinks i am having a sexual relationship with a girl he likes because she has hickeys on her neck that same week i had really bad scratch marks on my back not from her well he think something is going on and starts a fight with me at school and i break his nose in front of the entire school assembly later next week kurt girlfriend and hi am break up so the next day kurt is at my house we hang out not stop for about three weeks fishing hunting cruising for girl everything well lorine wants to get back with kurt so she brings out this story from way back in the past lorine and i were dating a long time ago she said that i was inviting her over to my house well i was to a party so she can see kurt but she tell i so kurt gets mad at me and tries to fight me at my own house during this party kurt is a very muscular guy and very big well i talk it out after we both have black eyes and we have not been close since anyway i now dating this really nice sweet girl who is very intelligent and pretty i just hope it stays as good as it is now
i used to day dream about this time when i was younger after i saw my brother and sister leave for college i decided that was going to be the best part of my life of course it is a lot different now that i am here there is a lot more responsibility in reality than there is in my dreams i dont really mind it so far i want to be able to handle it and i am excited about my classes i wish that i could be an expert in every subject that i take psychology is very interesting to me but not enough to be my major--i would not want to do it for the rest of my life my brother has a bachelors degree in psychology from southwest texas but he has not done much with it i am taking this class as a social science elective my other classes are required for my major right now i am an undeclared major but after a few classes in my geology of engineering course i am pretty sure that i want to major in geosystems engineering it seems to incorporate a large amount of subject material that i am interested in and it would be a job that pays pretty well if i did well enough at ut to get into grad school i would love to follow it up with a masters or phd in geology of all the courses i have taken in high school and college these seem to be the best ones some of my favorite subjects are geology geography astronomy archaeology and history i would love to be an astronomer in a second if it paid well enough my reason for this is that eventually i would like to have a large spread of land in the hill country somewhere west of austin--near a lake--with a boat this requires i love the outdoors and i want to live away from the city yet close enough to it that i could drive into town to do things this is probably a common ambition among people but i dont really care enough rambling about all that my reason for being here at ut is to learn and to get an education and to do well if i do all of this i will be very pleased it will be hard though i love to have fun and that can easily get in the way at ut i have not joined a fraternity or gone out for rush yet even though some of my friends who are in frats here keep bugging me i want to join some organization that has fun and kicks ass at a lot of things hopefully that will work out these are the things that are on my mind at the moment at least until i move on to the next thing
in the summer i had a surgery on my shoulder and currently i am in therapy the pain i am experiencing right now is pretty bad i am an athlete and i am used to bear with pain but all the pain i have had before was relatively voluntary i am also very anxious to get to my normal daily training my body is screaming for training but my body is not a problem my problem is my soul and mind i really miss diving and i want to come back and kick everybodys ass i am also anxious to start studying i am looking forward into this semester and i like my classes i feel very excited about school and want to get great grades this year thats all that i think about at the moment i am home sick and i want to go home i can go home for christmas but i want to go right now i want to be with my family i have not seen my family for over a year and i really miss them i want to be with my friends and see them every day they are all at home in russia and i can not wait to see them again some of them had babies recently and i want to see them as well i have known my friends for years and we are very close to each other i hope i will see them soon
first of all is my class me i dont want to be taking it at the moment but i will have to take it sooner or later i am not good at drawing and that is what the class is mainly about i would love to learn how to do that but i just wish i didnt have to get a grade i am more worried abut that class than i am about second year cal i could postpone the class and take it later maybe during the summer but i dont know it will be a hard class for me the other thing that is on my mind is whether or not i should play baseball that is a very complicated subject for me i would be a walk-on however several people who know have told me that i could easily make the team on the other hand that would be very time consuming i have a girlfriend back in waco who is still in high school and i really want to be able to see her i am afraid that if i played baseball then i would never be able to go home also i am an aerospace engineer and i will have a lot to do besides the other side is that i have the ability to play and if i dont then i will look back and wish that i had i have had to deal with this issue all summer if i do play baseball then i will likely have to change my schedule on the other hand i think that one of the reasons that i dont want to play is because i might be afraid of not making the team or of upper classmen or scholarship player harassment if i did make the team people have always told me not to take my girlfriend into consideration when making my decision but i cant do that they all think that just because i am going off to college that i will find a new girlfriend and i may but i dont want to and it wont be anytime soon weve already talked about marriage and how when she graduates from high school she could come live with me she is a junior right now so she has two more years i would love it if we could be living with each other right now in the year that we have been going out we have never had an argument i enjoy her company so much well that is what is on my mind at the moment
college is amazing my room roommate suitemates are all amazing however that call home always does it i am so in love yet my dad has to bring me down i understand i am only and that theyre thousands of fish in the sea however i am in love with this one i know i am because when i am with her i am the happiest man alive yet at the moment my feelings are so far removed from her i understand that this is my father in my brain and my rational thinking has overcome my emotional side he says not to let her visit however i must see her he will not stop my but hes trying to open me up to the thousands of women here at ut-austin i dont know i think about it every day shes different then the girls ive ever been with i guess shes different then the girls my parents want me to be with she is poor and has nothing to offer yet i am so in love and i know never have i felt this way for a girl before in my life i would do anything for her i mean this assignment of writing for minutes is nothing i could sit here for hrs weighing the pros and cons and just keep writing it is not a difficult task she is not causing me to be depressed you know how people can sometimes get all depressed over their long distance relationships and stress out i am eating like a madman as always going out at night with girls and partying you know i get my homework done and study hard i work out pledge my freaking frat and play lacrosse i am doing everything and performing well for me as well as my parents so why the fuck cant i just be allowed to have the one woman in life that makes me happy i understand that i am young yet this relationship is not difficult for me it is the second time ive ever been in a long distance relationship the first one was a bust and i vowed to never do it again so this past summer i went to camp sabra at the lake of the ozarks to be a counselor well i wasnt intending on meeting anyone however i believe that that word called fate has true meaning the first day we hit it off i wasnt intending on anything all i wanted to do was have a productive summer and come to ut free of love however you cant control love when it is real it just happened and i dont regret however i sometimes wonder if i didnt have her what life for me would be like i mean i am with all my buddies they dont have girl friends or anything coming into ut and it is not like theyve all of a sudden found someone i understand it is only the first week but i truly believe that what ive shared with this gorgeous somewhat deprived southern belle from nashville is i ampossible to ever experience with anyone else of course i could experience love with another baby but do i really want too i mean there is no way that the things we have been through together can ever be replayed i know deep down inside that i am in love with this girl it is tough because shes not here but what if she was here lets say she ends up going to ut or acc as talked about next year what if my girlfriend is here dad what if she lives in austin then what i mean ive got a girlfriend at school now right it is not like this is killing me or maybe it is look i am in love i know i am with my love i have no worries whatsoever i dont think about anything else when i am with her i am completely content so get off me i am planning on keeping my studies up the whole year ive signed with a wonderful fraternity i am playing lacrosse for the university of texas-austin i have an active social life not to brag you know but i am doing everything a college boy should be doing i am enjoying myself and to let this get in the way is ridiculous one must understand this situation is not in the way it is not holding me back from talking to other girls however i do not become inti amate with these ladies so what ill be fine i will see my love when we visit i just dont understand it is very stressful but i am handling it you see my older brother went through the same kind of shit but he screwed up he wasnt able to function and messed around freshmen year in college and ended up on academic probation i thought damn what if that happens to me but it is not a worry i am at college it is awesome and i am doing just fine were not holding on to each other we are in love and have so many dreams we want to fulfill it is not like i am crying all day to my buddies that i missed her i rarely ever do that i am functional you know i dont know i really dont know what the hell i just spattered out i am in love g-d damn-it and i am happy i just have to relax and get my fathers controlling voice removed from my head i hope i fulfilled the assignment it is been minutes of continuous writing guess what my mind still tells me i am in love aint that the darndest thing alright time to go ponder maybe i am relieved now see you
today i am very tired because last night i was up to two am to do my chemistry lab reports first i thought it was easy and it would not take me so long to do it but actually it required a lot of consideration and calculations after i finished writing the report i found out that the report must be typed the problem was i dont have a printer at home and at that time it was already ten at night i didnt want to go to the library so late but didnt want to get it done at the last minutes of tomorrow morning i went to knock at my neighbours doors and asked them if they had a printer i could borrow the lucky thing was that the second one i asked does has a printer and he let me borrowed it so the problem had been solved then after this i kept on writing my chemistry preli amenary write up i needed put the procedures and data table up that was a very long lab there were totally seven experi aments i need to do today and it spent me like eight pages for the pre-lab write up so today morning i went to the lab room and turned in my lab report at the beginning of class i am glad that i finally got it done but i dont know what would the grade be since i was in a hurry last night then i start to do my experi aments it took me almost four hours to finish and after that i was so exhausted since i didnt eat breakfast in the morning my data was so messy and i dont know if i could read them when i need to write the lab report again after the lab the first thing came up my mind was to go home and have a nice big sandwhich at one oclock i had my math discussion class i almost felt to sleep during that class since the topic the ta discussed was kind of boring and i already knew them after this class i had my biology discussion class this class is pretty cool because it took like minutes then we could go home so i went home and get on the line to have a little rest i was chatting with my friends checking email and surfing until my roommate came back then we did dinner together tonights dinner was good and it was the thing i enjoyed the most today ah two minutes left finally so what else i need to say so after the yummy dinner i started to write this assignment and now time is up i can go on to the next writing assignment my hands are so tired

what would happen without doing these writing assignments how in the world does the ta grade all off these papers with so many kids in the class he would have to go crazy trying to give everyone a grade the view from my window is so drab i wish i lived on the eighth or even the seventh floor so i did not have to look at this wall all day it is probably a nice day out but i cant tell because of this stupid wall i need to go to the store i hope that there is a good game of basketball at the gym today becasuse yesterday was boring the girls team we played against the other day wasnt half bad maybe they we show up again today that girl was cute too i wonder if she has a boyfriend that girl down the hall needs to come back from wherever she went she has the nicest hair i need a haircut i think that is the only reason i really want to go home is so i can get a haircut from teri i guess i could do it myself i think i have my clippers i can never reach all the way to the back oh well i really dont think it matters how your hair looks everyone is usually to drunk to even remember your name let alone how my hair looks i do feel better when my hair looks good though i think it gives me more confidence why is that i sure have a lot of questions maybe i should pray about them sometimes that works and with this whole college thing i could use some guidance man i am hungry i miss my moms cooking maybe i should go home for the weekend i am sure she misses me i hope the cafeteria hopefully is open today i think we are down to the last two poptarts and i am sure we ran out of oj and milk yesterday football starts next week and we need our lineup for the league i need to get that email address from brad to make sure we dont get penalized for being late or something gay like that i dont want to do that chemistry assignment filling in those scantrons is so tedious and pointless i cant get rid of this cough that medicine that i have been taking just tastes good and does absolutely nothing for my chest or throat i guess this is another day without food until we go to the store because the cafeteria is closed after one on holidays and with my laziness i didnt get up in time why didnt i set my alarm breakfast is worth missing one hour of sleep especially when we have no food to eat until dinner i need to go and check the mail maybe that girl will have her door open and i can stop and talk with her i wonder what she did this weekend long weekends are awesome i wish we always had three days off it is so much more relaxing knowing that it is already tuesday when you go to your first class it makes the week go so much faster does the mail come on labor day i dont think so but i really need to mail something oh well i guess it can wait until tommorrow
right now my thoughts are geared toward wether or not i just submitted a blank page because i hit the tab button so i could write in paragraph form and then boom the screen said you have submitted thankyou but anyways i hadnt even started right now i have no idea what i am supposed to be writing the assignment seems to easy usually that means i am doing something wrong right now my thoughts are concentrating on thinking of things to write i feel like i am in a sort of mellow mood after all theres not much excitng going on right know i have calculus to do and i almost dont want to pick up the book because i know i wont be able to do some andthen i may get a bad grade on the homework that means that i will get a bad grade in the class unless i do perfect on the tests well i wish i knew how to type not that this assignment would go by any faster sensations well i am sitting on a chair i can feel it supporting me i have this habit of biting my lips so i can feel that to only bite the inside of your lips because then they dont look all messed up all the time if someone reads this they are going to think strange things of me i wonder if the box keeps going yes it does wait agh a drink of water more sensations i felt the water coldly flow down my neck where i i amagine it is being mixed with luch which was a inch sub from po boys at least it was relatively healthy but it is more expensive than wendys oh man i hope that somebody doesnt call because i might have to write this over again or does the computer automatically kick you off the internt when you have been on for more than minutes and not done anything that would be bad does that mean that i would have to go back and write this all over again well i cant wait to get this done because i get to relax for one damn second of the day ive been up since walking around carrying ahuge bag on my back it makes me hunch over because if i stand up straight then i would fall over i hope i dont have a bad back when i am older at least ill be smart wow ive already been writing for minutes probably about the wrong stuff but hey another sensation is my fingers hitting the keyboard and i can see the keyboard my cell phone just rang i could hear that well anyways this whole minute thing is leaving me with nothing else to think about i wonder what other people wrote actually i could care less their interpretation of the directions is no better than mine but anyways i really hope this actually submit is after all it is the last minute i am glad paul reminded me
well i just got back from my home town in huntsville today i went down there for my granny and paw paws fiftieth wedding anniversary i think today was the hardest move i ever made it as my first trip home since i moved down here the first time wasnt as hard as today was i guess i realized that i dont live there anymore when i was leaving i thought to myself i have to go home but this doesnt feel like home to me huntsville does i had a blast while i was there i got to see most of my friends including my girlfriend which i was basically forced to break up with because of my move cause everyone knows that long distance relationships dont work but it was like nothing had even changed i had so much fun with her and with my old friends i honestly didnt want to come back today i cried the most ive ever cried in my life today the hardeset thing for me was to see my mom cry i think she realized that i was actually gone as well i could also tell my dad was fighting back the tears the only other time i have ever seen my dad almost close to crying was when his grandmaw died me and hi am are best friends he told me he loved me today which i have not heard out of his mouth in a while because you know were men as i pulled out of my driveway my mom and dad were hugging each other they have never done anything but scream and yell at each other since my years of living there i burst into tears at the sight and drove off with that pain in youre neck you get when you try to fight back tears this still wasnt as bad as when i had to tell my exgirlfriend bye again she was the last person i saw before i left and i spent about an hour over there we talked about how much fun we used to have i wish i could see her more often she gave me my birthday present today because i wont be home for it she wrote me the sweetest card and i started to cry again then i opened the present and it was a fairly expensive watch and i burst into tears again i realize how much she really is in love with me and i wish i was there to share that with her it is going to be even harder to get usec to living down here now to end with a good note every one i visited sent me lots of food back thanks for listening i feel a lot better now
today has been a good day at first i was afraid that ut was going to be a difficult experience for me since i had never been far away from home for more than one week but it has turned out well ive met a lot of people last night i had a really good time even though i was out really late it was an enjoyable experience i have tried to maintain friendships with people from my small town of laredo although many of them werent close friends they are still a contact to a world so different from the world that i used to live in nonetheless i dont think i want to live in the past i want to live life to the fullest in fact i decided a few days ago that the only way to adjust and have fun i have to remember that i am a naturally outgoing person even though shyness sometimes overcomes me due to this i have met more people i do hope that the people i have met so far arent psycho though you never know who you are talking to in a town this size or what that person must be thinking last night i had to ask some random person for a ride because the dorm dorms were locked and there was no one there to answer under any normal circumstances i would not have done such an irresponsible and dangerous acts but i was scared and i didnt want to spend the night in the lobby as a result i see that ut and austin are turning me into a new person that i always wanted to be uninhibited fun wild although these characteristics have always been in me i realize now that they are barely rearing their heads for a a new beginning of adventure and excitement i dont miss home as much as i thought i would i see that freedom and self-rule has begun to change my personality hopefully for the better however i cant help but think that it may all be wrong what if home is what kept me safe and secure being away from my boyfriend is the hardest it has been two weeks since i last saw hi am and already doubts have sprung into my mind i think of hi am and dont miss hi am the way i thought i would i do in a way but not as badly as expected a friend told me to keep her posted on my feelings and what i was thinking but i feel that talking about my lack of feelings would be almost as bad as being unfaithful to hi am nontheless ut is proving to be a different and definitely exciting experience that i hope to enjoy for many more years the future lies ahead and i await it with an anxiousness i have never known i hope it all works out in the end
well another night of staying up late i dont know why i dont really want to go to bed i guess i just dont feel like it or i feel like i have to do something before i go to bed but then something else pops up i think i got used to not sleeping during my time in the army kind of fun back then the army usually pops in my head late at night when i am on the computer because thats what i did in the army i can tune everything out and just have the humming of the computer and only the light from the screen providing light for the room reminds me of sitting in the track at or am shooting missions i wonder where i would be if i would have stayed in i bet i would have gone to korea for a year then back to fort sill i wish i would have gone to korea as soon as i got out of ait those guys came back better trained than the guys who stayed in the states i probably could have used that year being away from everybody i hope it doesnt rain tomorrow man i hate the rain i remember in virginia i missed all the rainy days at school i guess i got lucky it only seemed to rain on tuesdays and thursdays i miss virginia the leaves the snow the mountains and the lake right behind the apartment man everyday there was football weather i cant believe they lost to byu last week man i hate byu
yesterday in class we talked about what different parts of the brain are in control with one interesting part to me is the occipital lobe three years ago i was in a car accident which i have fully recovered from expect i have blurred vision in my right eye within a few months after the accident i went to many doctors to see what the problem was one doctor concluded that my optic nerve had been jarred which can cause loss of eyesight he said that after a year if my nerve turned white then that meant that this is what happened he also said that i would never regain my eyesight in that eye now that it is three years later there is still no sign that my optic nerve was injured and my eyesight has gradually come back but it is a very slow process another doctor could not reach a conclusion but he figured that it might have something to do with my brain he told me that you could never tell if the brain can overcome such a catastrophe but the brain can do miraculous things sometimes during the semester i may come in a see what you think it could be because no one else seems to come to a conclusion matching another professionals opinion i do not know if such a thing could happen to the occipital lobe so i would like to come in and see if just part of your eyesight can be affected if this lobe has damage done to it
i am so mad right now i have tried so many times to go to the internet site for this class and it says error the url i am upset this thing is due friday so now i am in word waiting for the stupid site to be fixed i just got off the phone and the conversation made no sense there was a party in the town i am from and some guy got stabbed and died he was and from san antonio the weird thing is that no one knows who stabbed hi am now to me this makes no sense they were at a party there are usually people everywhere oh well i have a lot of stuff to do me and allison are going apartment hunting tomorrow it is weird ive only known her since i moved here in august and already we are good friends and plan on living together next year we want to live at orange tree because it is cute i looked on the internet for some info on it and there is none i think it is stupid that we have to go apartment shopping in september for a place we wont move into for almost a year oh well we are doing it now so we dont get screwed i was just talking to corey my cute boyfriend and i was telling hi am about the pleasure center in mice and how different it was from humans i always tell hi am what ive learned in class because it helps me remember it i feel sorry for hi am i would not want to hear it if i were hi am hes so nice like that i ordered cookies last night from tiffanys treats they deliver freshly cooked cookies to your door anyway i was in a friends room at hardin housewhich i hate and we were talking about boyfriends and stuff i told them i want to get married on november to corey they laughed and asked why so i told them weve actually talked about marriage and we both love each other that much so it is cool we want to live together in a couple of years actually he is going to live near us at orange tree if at all possible he has a brother who is a year younger codey who is a pothead he has a girlfriend amy who i dont like shes only a freshman in high school but she doesnt belong with hi am corey and codey are total opposites i have a lot of work to do tonight i have to do calculus read for my freshman seminar and do my italian work i got a quiz back today from that class and i got a i was so upset i am used to as italian is not a required course for my major so i was wondering if i could take it passfail that would be good then it couldnt bring down my gpa i need to ask some one about that i hate my roommate and suitemate they are so damn loud caroline the suitemate has people over now who are very loud i like it quite but that doesnt happen here at hardin house i went through rush this year and got a bid from a chi o but i decided not to pledge i am glad i didnt because they are out all of the time and i am taking hours this and every other semester i want to finish in three years so i have to take hours every semester and in each summer session thats cool with me though since i dont feel really comfortable here my dad is an accountant for the floresville isd in floresville tx we dont have the major bucks which is totally opposite from the girls that live here we arent poor by any means i have a eclipse which my dad got me for my birthday last year my brother is premed here at ut actually hes supposed to graduate in december he took an extra semester to take some business courses hes really smart but he likes to party he was a fiji and that is just a synonym for partier i dont like to party much at all if i didnt have corey id probably party but i am just not compelled to get drunk on friday and saturday and spend sunday recuperating that is not my idea of a good time it used to be though my sophomore year i was the party queen i have never done drugs in my life no pot coke or anything i did drink a lot but i dont anymore the last time i got drunk was a roundup in april i threw up on my own shoe needless to say i dont do that anymore corey has never been drunk before hes so innocent to meet but only i know the real hi am i think thats cool i just got an email from my exboyfriend we dated for almost a year and a half but i had to break up with hi am because i liked corey more me and corey will have been together for months on hes so wonderful i am obsessed with hi am which is okay by me id do anything for hi am my birthday is the day of the houston game my family is coming down and so is corey hes only a senior we are planning on going to hudsons on the bend which is one of my absolute favorite places ever we ate at the oasis on friday we got lost but it was still fun i was so scared when we got to my brothers house he lives on the east side of which is really scary we were trying to unlock the door and a car parked across the street and watched up get in
i am thinking this is a different assignment and that it is going to be hard to just let thoughts come in naturally since i am used to having a specific reason for writing i always shake my leg yes i do it all the time like it is a nervous reaction i think i am tense to often always worrying about what i need to be doing or what i should be doing i am trying to relax right now so that i am not tense stress keeps being the topic of discussions in my classes health promotions eeh my leg is shaking again nutrition and psychology these classes seem to be overlapping each other a lot during subject matter i dont know why i kept avoiding this assignment i have been putting it off i think i feel incompetent when it comes to writing it is not something i would consider myself skilled at yes writing inti amidates me i shouldnt think that i am so inferior i bet yall dont even read these hmm i wonder if you will read that sentence maybe maybe not should i be using proper grammar and punctuation because i really like to go like this yeah i do it all the time when i am conversing over the internet the internet i am suspicious of the internet it cant be all that good i spend way too much time online just another distraction in this world that leads people away from the i amportant things in life i cannot possibly write all that i am thinking about because random thoughts float in and out of my head and i cant type them all and i forget them by the time i finished what i was typing ok six minutes i am suppose to be natural i dont think i am i wonder if i should stay on subjects longer because i really want to i dont like all this jumping around i think the main thing is that it has to be continuous well that is easy i am always thinking i think too much sometimes if thats possible you know whats been on my mind i just got back from this scholarship dinner i have no idea how i got that scholarship i think they mixed up my name with someone else i just seemed way under qualified compared to all the other recipients wow there are some amazing people here some incredible smart and talented people and i need to stop feeling inferior to them because i have my good points also and i am a very happy person i am content with my life i wonder how many people really are struggling here everyone seems like they are just fine and dandy but you know some people are really sad people can hide their emotions easily i doubt thought that a third of the people in my psychology class are depressed if that is true than that is very sad i will admit it i am cynical of depression yeah sure everything is biological and you can trace it back to that and call it a disease but really your mind thats where you control it i keep hearing how our mind can heal us and how we think has an enormous i ampact do we not have control over our mind that should be the one thing we do have control over and that is where the power is is it really incorrect to say that depression is all in your mind i think not i guess that i am not being fair to the depressed people because my life is good close enough to perfect for me i am lucky to not have to deal with all the garbage many people have to deal with i had a good child hood good parents no worries really but it is not like ive never been depressed i spent most of my freshman year in high school depressed but now i look back and understand why i felt that way and how silly it was and i dont plan on doing that again i guess you just have to live and learn i mean it is ok to do whats wrong just as long as you eventually figure out it is wrong and fix it ok what was that all about i ramble so much it is hard for me to have conversations with people because my mind always feels like it is in places at once i am tired i really am i always feel a little tired i had a terrible encounter with mono my freshman year in high school it was horrible and ever since then i get tired easily maybe it is all in my head and i can convince myself that i am not tired i should try this it could be very beneficial i am already starting to procrastinate why why is procrastination and epidemic among youth hey i think time is up i could go on for hours but i really should get to my other homework or not

right now i am sitting in my dorm room and i just got off the internet with my old boyfriend matt he is still in plano and i feel as if part of me is still there with hi am the worst of it all is that he has a new life now and he is finding new people and new things to do since he is doing this he has found every way to make it very clear that i am not to be a part of this new life he is enjoying so much although there is no room for me in this life there is plenty of room for tons of other girls that understand what he is going through i dont really think that it is fair for hi am to expect me to just sit here and let hi am make a new life for hi amself that i am not in but he does not seem to understand that because the only circumstance he sees is that i am in college in austin and that my life must be better than his so there is no need for me to be a part of his boring life in plano i pretty much do not think that austin is that great and i would trade being in college to be with hi am in a heartbeat i do not think that he is being fair sympathetic or a good friend to me at all he doesnt seem to understand that college is a scary thing and that it really helps to know that there is someone there for you that is a steady constant in your life during a time of constant change such as this one he just doesnt understand and he just doesnt really care all that he really cares about is that he is having a good time which obviously cannot involve me the only thing that he can ever see is that i am in college and that there is going to be so much distance between the two of us the only thing that he seems to able to do about this is to put even more distance between the two of us this really bothers me and the worst of it is that i have been gone for a total of seven days and he has already found a way to replace the void i have left in his life it makes me feel very wanted to know that i can be replaced in seven days and the worst of it is that i totally want to be with hi am every moment of every day and he just doesnt want to be i feel that if i were to come home for a weekend that he would not even have the time to see me because he would be so busy with some other person he doesnt even have the time to talk to me for five minutes yet he has time to go to bible study for three hours he doesnt understand how unwelcoming that college is and how much i would like to have someone right now that really wants me to be there and that really cares about me this whole situation is very difficult because we are so far apart and there is no way to see each other and there is no way to make hi am see how much i care about hi am or how much i really want to be a part of his life and on top of all of my turmoil with hi am i also had to go through rush this week and not get into a sorority this all makes me feel very wanted and liked by others so basically my first week of college has been pretty good i am sick i have all eight oclock classes and i am not a morning person i have been replaced in the life of one of the few people i have ever truly cared for i have been cut by sororities even though all of the girls in my town have joined the houses of their choice i live in a really tiny old dorm with a bunch of weird people and i have broken the brand new portable telephone in my bedroom oh well it can only get better form here right
although i have waited until the very last minute to start this assignment it was totally out of my control ive been dealing with getting my laptop and setting up my internet for about two weeks now the ethernet card was finally put into today but only after harassing the front desk of my dorm about twenty times so now i am connected to all my friends who either moved or do not go to ut but even though i might be connected i barely ever get any real information about their lives from them one of my best friends moved to college station to go to school it might be only a twohour drive but i have not seen her in almost a month that is really hard when before she left we were seeing each other almost every day and i dont feel i am making enough of a conscious effort to keep in touch with her maybe i think that if i dont speak to her then i wont miss her ive also been overwhelmed with the changes of moving away from home meeting new people and getting adjusted so i might just be extremely busy right now too much on my mind ive wanted to graduate high school and be on my own since i was about twelve ive always been extremely responsible and independent not really seeing the need for strict authority parents teachers etc so i figured moving out of my house and into a new environment would be a breeze ive adjusted all right i do my homework dont stay out late on school nights and go to all my classes psychologically though is a different story i never realized how much id miss my parents and only now do i really appreciate what they do for me i got sick about the second week i moved into my dorm and all i could think about was how i wanted my mom to take care of me me miss independent just wanted someone to cook soup for her and tell her what kind of medicine to take also dealing with campus size has been kind of hard i grew up in a small town and went to a small high school where i practically knew everyone i am living with a friend from high school so thats made it a little easier but still i dont feel like an individual anymore i feel like one in a huge crowd which is exactly the case especially in this class how do you get to know people when you sit by someone different every day and there are over five hundred people that walk through the doors thats almost three times my graduating class five hundred is half the town of dripping springs it is so different and yet i am only thirty miles away from home i also have not really found much to get involved with i am not into sports and at this point i have not really experienced anything that i love doing and want to pursue the only thing ive really done as a group is me my roommate and a friend from one of my classes went to a pill start class which is what it sounds like starting birth control thats another thing i got to this class yet i am not sexually active and i feel like such a minority here in college i went to the class as a preventative measure you now a just in case it happens when i am drunk or not thinking straight or maybe even if i get into a relationship where i actually trust my partner i have this huge overwhelming fear of pregnancy and i think thats stopped me from being inti amate and i am not sure if thats a good thing yeah it has kept me from having sex but i am also in a state of fear about the issue i am worried my sister my friends anyone and everyone is going to get pregnant and that scares me i worry so much about other people and i feel responsible for them like i am always offering to take so and so to go get birth control then they look at me like i am a freak and explain to my how theres really no way they can get pregnant i mean they are using condoms and all i can do is look at them and think oh my god how can anyone be so nonchalant about such an i amportant issue if i ever got pregnant my life would change so much it is way too much to even think about and i dont ever want to have to make the decision of if i should keep the baby i love children so much but i dont want them now when i cant provide for them or give them the life i know they deserve but i dont really think abstinence is the answer either i think that at some point i am going to just have to get over this fear i dont have a problem with sex i just have a problem with all the scary things that can result from it ten minutes of pleasure is not worth disease death or even a new life right now
my english teacher should go back to her own country she read my essay today and she couldnt understand a word on it my topic is on samesex marriage but she didnt even know that samesex marriages are illegal in the u s she read through the whole thing and asked me so what is your point at first i thought it was just me so i took it to the writing center in a way i just wanted to talk to someone i had to complain about her to someone anyways the guy in the writing center agreed with me it is not my problem that she cant read well i guess it is since she is the one whos going to grade my paper but i am not going to put up with her i am so going to change my teacher tomorrow i am so glad that i still have the chance i feel really relieved because my rough draft is done i finally feel like i am getting somewhere with my paper i am also very excited because the weekend is coming up i am going to finish my homework in one day and enjoy the rest of my weekend maybe i will do my homework for the next week ahead of time so i will have more time during the week i dont know i seem to be addicted to homework lately my dad said that i wont be happy if i move out well i dont think that is true at all i admit that college life is much harder than i have ever i amagined but living with hi am doesnt change that a bit it is not like he could help me with my homework he never did anyway i feel so relieved after i moved out it is great that i only have to deal with school dealing with my dad is much harder than anything else i have not really talked to my mom for a week now i dont really know if i should call her she is so worried about me in a way she is giving me a lot of stress we are always talking about the same thing now she keeps trying to convince me to move back there is just no way that i am going do it
this is going to be a cool assignment we just get to talk about what is going on right now in our lives i think college is going to be really awesome we are going to learn so much from all the different types of classes we are taking i am very tired from classes today it is tiring to walk all around campus i will not take the loop cause i dont want to be lost or anything i think that would be scary to get lost on the loop my roommate just left to the coop she has to return all these books my computer is pretty slow and i hope it doesnt break down while i am typing this i think that jester is pretty nice i am glad that my suitemates are really cool they take me places cause they have cars one is from katy and my other suitemate is from austin my really good friend is sleeping because she is waiting for me to eat we are going to go eat at jester probably it should be interesting cause i really dont like to eat jester food that much it was alright at lunch but i think it is going to be pretty gross tonight people stare in the windows at jester it is weird to think that there are people out there that could be looking at you it is really has a pretty courtyard though i am so tired i dont think i have much homework to do tonight though it should be interesting because i have to write a paper for english i really dont know what i should write it about though i have no idea gregory is a really cool place you get to run and workout i like to play volleyball that has been lots of fun being able to play at night ut has really cool places to see around it too i think i have eaten out so much people here are so different i think that is really cool though cause if they werent this place would be really boring and stuff the computer is sometimes a waste of time i know so many people that just sit and chat on the computer for hours i think it is really fun too but you dont need to stay on it for a couple of days people think that college is really easy and therefore dont have to study i think they are going to get a rude awakening sometime my suitemate is trying to work her computer it is pretty funny cause she doesnt really know how to work it my sisters just sent me a care package it was really cool it had like some soap and candy it also had like pictures and stuff i have to move out soon cause of the pipes are being installed well my friend says to write about the future i dont know about the future it should be pretty interesting i hope i think that i will have to study a lot this year my sister is going to try to help me out though hopefully she is going to have it hard i am going to play i am sports i hopefully will be able to handle everything cause i know it is really going to be hard and stuff i eat too much i am pretty full and all and we are going to go eat soon i only have a couple more minutes so i will talk about how my computer is not working for some reason when i got home it was broken my friend tried to fix it i think it will be alright my favorite tennis player won the us open yesterday it was pretty cool he is really cool he is from russia i am tired once again i just want to finish this i have taken psychology before so i hopefully will be able to help my friends also that are in my class all the people from where i am from all hang out with each other it is pretty funny i think that everyone should meet new people my friends tried out for the mtv show i dont know if they made it though my time is up i am very happy
the green leaves outside are a very vibrant color of green today i really hope it doesnt rain again today because i got really wet yesterday that ticking closk is really annoying me i never really notice it until i i have to go to work though theres my sisters harry potter book i wonder if the next movie that comes out will be any good i really hope it is i have no idea why my dad is so into trains right now hes been collecting them everywhere i think this is his midlife crisis hobby we had to drive four hours this summer to go to a little dinky town called rusk just to ride a steam train it wasnt really worth it i wanted the train to go under a tunnel or something but it never did that french toast i made this morning really wasnt very good i left a funny taste in my mouth i should probably go brush my teeth they have syrup all over them i am so tired i shouldnt have stayed up as late as i did last night putting my thoughts on paper is really hard i have no idea what to write my arm hurts i think it is because i have not streched it since volleyball season last year i hope the team does well this year i am pretty confident they will they have some really good players this year i wonder how good of a player mr paces daughter really is she made varsiity this year as a freshmen but then again thats really not too hard to do considering the new coach seems to be aa good coach though i really hope shes able to build up a strong team i wish that i could play for one more year volleyball is so much fun i wonder if i could get a team together to play intramural volleyball that would be a whole lot of fun dawn alread y said she didnt want to do it she is so unmotivated sometimes i think we need one of those wrist pads for our computer my hand is getting tired it is probably just because i have not typed hardly anything for the entire summer i really want to take a typing class somewhere so i would learn how to type a lot faster that would make papers a lot easier to write
ummm have not done this since th grade thinking always gets ahead of the recording allergys in the air uncomfortable contacts greggs still here said he was going to the store grammars gotten lax cats on the couch at least theyre not playing place is messy-i should clean but i probably wont twenty minutes is a rather long time is that to get to the truer feelings after getting too bored for anything else in i had a feeling that was the purpose of the hour questionaire i dont know if i spent hours but it took forever and i started the questions too late at night after answering pages of them i didnt want to back out have a foam party experi ament scheduled friday i am peeved that they didnt give you any idea what you were signing up for is it necessary not to fill in the participants and my vision isnt it is not terribly far from but i hope they dont check and kick me out i never use this desk the one at home and it is filled with papers and trash that isnt mine i hate stacks of other peoples paper filled with cryptic scribbles i dont feel like i can throw it out but the odds of it being valuable are pretty sli am strip tease with demi moore is on cable tonight ive never seen it but i watch minutes of it tonight but decided to turn it off i am trying to watch less crap tv but it seems like thats all there is lately i wonder when the new season starts i should try to watch something other than fox this year it is easy to get locked into one network if you only see that networks commercials but if i am only going to watch one i guess it should be something other than fox my typing has gotten pretty decent i used to typewpm but typing at work has i amproved that most of my practice though is personal email at work i waste way too much time online instead of working it is just so easy with the way my computer faces i wonder how obvious it is though i am rambling but i feel like i am suppose to be talking to someone i say used and supposed i am fairly sure thats wrong but not sure which is sad i always say it and i can live with that but i type it too and can never decide if i should make a change or not gregg said he was going to the store i am paranoid about hi am reading it for some reason he just walked up behind me and started to read some and i asked hi am not to it is silly-theres nothing in here that he doesnt already know and i ramble just like this to hi am frequently probably too frequently and dont have to screen my thoughts much at least less than with anyone else but ive always been shy about my writing i would not even let my parents read the dryest of papers that i wrote much less ones that were on personal matters fish tank in the room we let moss grow pretty heavily before we bought a cleaning fish the fish has done a good job though and it is a good thing we only have neons and guppies cant kill em boredom boredom only minutes to go i wonder how many of these will be read through and i wonder how many of these wonder how many of these will be read through are all people boring like me even witty entertaining people are there thoughts more exciting does being on mean acting like something not really being ones boring self strange itch it my back i know it is silly but lately ive felt creaky like the very mild beginning twinges of getting old i should excersize i know i should i get winded going up a flight of stairs and i can stand to lost or pounds i try to diet even though i know the sucess rate from dieting alone calorie restriction is dismal and the atkins diet thing although it evidently works for many people it is obviously targeted diet in my opinion that may not be fair but from my own observations women are much more likely to eat a carbohydrate based diet while men like to get more calories from meat atkins calls a carbohydrate diet unnatural and unhealthy and thats ludicrious perhaps his diet is healthy but it doesnt follow that the other is not only five seconds left does the timer stop by it iself went over time but couldnt resist finishing the sentance shave and a hair cut two bit is
well i think that i need to practice working on my team games more my teammates and i have very little coordination amongst ourselves we always just end up doing things individually instead of as a team zendt usually ends up spamming huntresses by hi amself in a corner travis makes a few footman and then techs to knights which usually then get killed and i try to scout or tech myself their is no over-arching strategy to our game which is the problem in a one-on-one game i only have to be concerned with what i am doing and making and only what my single enemy is doing or making i have decided to dub the name of our team team suck because we are that terrible oh well i can still tower rush the newbs on battle net any day amazingly enough i dont have a lot of work to do tonight aside from this assignment i am doing right now so that i can go ahead and have it out of the way hopefully i wont have any work to do this weekend when the fam comes to visit and even if i do i will just do as much as i can on sunday night instead of burdening myself with it while they are here it is not that i dont have a work ethic it is just that i prioritize doing things with them above reading out of a textbook which i will be doing all the time while i am here at ut they are only going to be around for a few days and then i may not see them again until the next break i wonder when it will start getting cold around here i brought my jacket but i shouldnt need it until october or so i believe my bathroom is quite the feces-infested cesspool right now i should probably do something about that it is beginning to get kind of nauseating but perhaps if i can out-last the guy next door he will do it before i do pretty sick i know but i did it when i first got here and ill be damned if i get to do it every time i should also vacuum the room that is getting pretty disgusting as well crumbs and such will attract all kinds of vermin eventually i wonder how often if ever they spray for bugs around here a couple of times ive gone into the bathroom and found one in the tub or on the floor one time i actually stepped on one before i knew what it was in the dark that was quite nasty there zendt goes i aming me while i am doing my writing assignment must not answer it must continue my non-sequitious train of thought i wonder if i spelled non-sequitious correctly if i spent a few seconds checking it on dictionary com it shouldnt cut into my writing aw screw it who cares if the prof or ta or whoever reads this thinks i am an illiterate boob i dont think they are checking on spelling anyway i bet there are other stream of consciousness writings by students who have trouble writing in english because they are from other countries so why should i care if i have a few typos i could pretend i am a foreigner from germany or some crap even if it did matter except now ive written it in here so they would have incri aminating evidence wow this is too much digression into an idiotic train of thought must think of something else to type about um i think i am losing my focus a little now man my nails are dirty look at that that charcoal ive been using is a damn mess i hope that we dont do too many more charcoal drawings now those blind contour drawings are so much cleaner i wonder if they will egver get more cups in the kitchen i am getting pretty effin sick of bringing my own cup to dinner that is pure bovine-cacka i wonder if they care about me typing cuss words in here better not do it just to be on the safe side must try to maintain some false sense of professionalism time is almost up now
right now i am sitting in my dorm room the tv is on and the band called the calling is playing i really like theyre music they kind of soothe my thoughts and put me at ease music plays an integral role in how my attitude is for a certain day or time many times ill listen to something that is very hard and angry and it will put me in a bad mood however that rarely happens i am really kind of worried about my laundry at this time i have honestly never washed any clothes so it presents a particularly daunting task to myself i have just realized how long minutes is and it seems a lot longer than what i figured it would be although this task isnt particularly challenging it is interesting to try to think about what i am thinking about many times i think the things i am thinking of are reflected by hearing as well as sight ive noticed this because i am listening to music now and the song is a mellow number that is making me really relaxed i need to make some gatorade because i drank all of it yesterday reese witherspoon is really hot theres a picture of her in front of me and she is beautiful now theres two songs playing at the same time and that is sort of bothering me first of all because i like them both second of all because it is hard to keep up with both of them earlier i mentioned that my laundry was bothering me well that is really a trivial task more precendent on my mind is making good grades in my classes college is easy so far however i have not had any tests and just one quiz in my spanish class i think i fared ok on that quiz so i am happy about that however i am still very curious as to what i actually made when i first got to jester my allergies acted up really bad due to the inordinate amount of dust in the room after the first week i got accli amated to it i guess and now i am doing just fine i had an appointment at the ssb to get my allergy shots this afternoon so i treked over there after i ate lunch when i got there the lady informed me that she had double booked the nurse in charge of giving shots she was paranoid that i would be mad at her but of course i wasnt mad it takes a lot to get me mad and something like that is just a minor inconvenience to me so i just went about my way i am also happy that i got my computer problem resolved seether put on a great show at ozzfest on saturday their lead singer sounds a lot like kurt cobain who was awesome all of seethers songs were really great they i ampressed me chevelle put on a good show too as did lost prophets wow i find myself continually looking at the time above to see how close i am to getting finished with this assignment i am really thirsty another thing that perplexes me is the experi aments for this class i suppose ill try to sign up for something after i finish this typing assignment i am really kind of worried about getting all those experi aments done and all that i guess that worry stems from not knowing that much about the experi aments lately my feet have started hurting a little bit well i guess it is not really a hurt but more of a burn perhaps my soles are giving out wow i am almost finished i have less than seconds left this was really kind of cool the minutes went by pretty fast bye
today is the anniversary of the attack on the twin towers i have not been thinking about this all day i am ages or feelings appear or become evident now and then i sometimes feel very emotional to the point where my eyes my moisten up and sometimes i feel a bit angry or nervous thinking about what the world is coming to we arent safe anymore at least the way we were before the th i mean the nice safe world i lived in two years ago was a comfortable one i didnt doubt the future of humanity our country or our safety now i occasionally do doubt and most of all thinking about the th and how there seems to be evident hate extreme hate towards america i am angry at the world at people i dont know who in particular just angry that this the world my sister who is will grow up in she is a very close part of me i feel very close and love her very much shes my little sis and to think that she now has to deal with these new realities of the world and people and her country some day is sad to me i mean on ond hand i am thinking come on nothing drastic is going to happen you live in texas far from the events far from danger she will be fine i will be fine and then i get this sense of coumminty and how we are all in this together and how i am american and she is american and we are hated by people who have the power to kill many people to infiltrate our country and live among us without recognition this is bad alyssa is her name and she is so adorable smart funny i would be devistated if anything happened to her i would feel terrible if she felt scared or hopeless about the new world once she realizes what has happened i feel that it is partially my responsibility to be there for her and educate her of the events and of the new ideologies that americans have adopted i am responsible to help her through these events these new realities as much as i can because i do not want her to fear life i want so much the perfect safe comfortable world i grew up in to be the world she will grow up in but i face the facts and realize that it most likely will not be i find myself still in this private world of disbelief or like i am alternating bewteen a world where i realize the new threats involved with iraq and the possibility of war just recently i started paying close attention to the news coverage of saddam hessein and his disregard to un weapons inspections and how he is a tangible threat to our security realizing this going to war is more of a possibility in my mind i relize the seriousness of the iraq conflict the seriousness of the th events terrorists and all that now more than ever maybe because i am older or am paying closer attention to the news reading more articles in newspapers nevertheless i am bothered by this whole change in our world i have a lot of homework to do a girlfriend tuition and bills to pay a career to study for i have plans of becoming a doctor one day and i have just recently realized how much work that is going to be i never anticipated this much stress or responsibilities in college i am should this much stuff be present in my life you know i heard amazing grace today played at one of the memorial ceremonies on tv tonight and was emotionally moved that song always does that to me it can played on the trumpet piano organ or bagpipes-it doenst matter it always gets to me i wonder what it is about that song that moves me so much that was the first song i ever played on the piano and trumpet if i am remembering correctly i miss my parents mostly my little sister i am going back this weekend but i am starting to contemplate whether or not that is a good idea because i have mcuh homework to finish i guess thats another struggles i am dealing with in my life currently i started thinking about how much i love my grandparents they live right up a little path from our house in san antonio and i realized that they will not be on this earth for too much longer i would see them all the time growing up and even through high school now i rarely ever see them because i am in college i will hopefully have years and years after their deaths to study or do whatever is it wise and the best thing for me to miss out on the time i have now to spend with them is spending time in college worth the sacrifice i am making why cant i spend as much time with them as possible now when we are here on earth together before they pass on
i si amply dont know where to start having a timer count down how long i have to type is kind of stressful for me i feel like i have to rush to write enough for twenty minutes but then how would the teacher know if i really did type the whole twenty minutes what if i was a naturally slow typer however i am a good typer so i will have plenty of stuff to write i just got back from my chemistry class and we learned nothing new i am surprised at how well i seem to be understanding everything in that class considering the fact that my high school chemistry teacher was a nutcase i am like my current chemistry teacher because she teaches things in a nice normal way unlike my previous teacher i learned about the basics more today like density and specific gravity and all the other good chemistry stuff on the way back home however i learned that my flip flops were not the best type of shoes to walk a long time in because they gave me blisters on the tops of my feet the plastic that goes into the foamy part of the shoe made a sharp angle and kept rubbing into my skin until it was raw i am now in pain because i was not very careful when choosing the type of shoe to wear to class today was the first day since i arrived in austin that i have worn shorts i finally gave in and accepted the fact that it is just too hot here to keep wearing jeans all the time i felt like i was being a slob because i wore a big t shirt and cotton shorts i felt like i should be going to the gym instead of chemistry when i got back home i saw some people sunbathing in the pool i wonder why anyone would want to sunbathe now when it is already so hot and sunny all the other days of the week how odd i am relieved that it is friday--the end of the week i can now relax and enjoy myself with my friends today was also a good day because i finally got internet service which is why i chose to do my assignment today i find myself not capitalizing any of my letters that should be capitalized because on aol instant messenger i dont need to punctuate or capitalize very well or accurately my sister just got a call from a friend and i am wondering who is calling i really want to know but i cant ask her because she is still talking from hearing her talk i think the caller is one of our friends who is in her philosophy class i am feeling a little hungry right now becuase i ate lunch at noon and it is been a while since i fed myself i had a few cheese nips before i started but i regret leaving them in the kitchen because now i cant eat as i type oh well thats ok because if i did eat while i did this assignment the keyboard would get all oily and i would not be very pleased with myself i guess i should eat after finishing this assignment i see that still have seven minutes to go so what am i thinking right now i still feel the pain in my foot from my stupid shoes i am also excited because i get to hang out with my friends this evening i might see a movie speaking of movies i am planning on seeing the robin williams movie one hour photo next week with my friends i am excited because robing williams is a good actor and i enjoy most of his movies i am kind of apprehensive because it is supposed to be a thriller or scary movie i hear my printer printing my sisters assignment and i am getting annoyed at it because it is so loud i am wondering why i bought this printer knowing that it was loud in the consumer reports it said that the printer was good but loud but i bought it anyway because it was cheaper than the one that i was looking at maybe i shouldnt have gone the cheap way oh well it is a little late now what should i eat for dinner i want to eat out instead of cooking for myself because i am lazy and i dont want to make something i want someone else to do the dirty work and me to enjoy the results i cant wait until dinnertime but i cant eat anymore because i have eaten too much already i am kind of tired today because i had to wake up early to wait for the cable guy i think i will take a break after this assignment and sleep a little that would be nice because then i will be refreshed this evening yesterday i couldnt sleep but i dont know why that was it might have been the outside noise from people coming and going from the parties around here i hate the inconsiderate people who dont think about how their noise affects others
it is i think ill type up the time as a reference even though there is a timer at the top as i sit here looking around and typing without looking at the keyboard i wonder what my girlfriend is doing since i am using her computer cant wait till monday i finally get my own internet set up at my apartment i feel like i am getting sick i was sneezing a lot the other day now i have a slight sore throat i wonder what the purpose of this assignment is is someone actually going to read this or is it just busy-work gah i hate this runny nose my girlfriend sure has a lot of pictures of me a little too many hope she is getting a good work-out at the gym right now i need to find more time to go to the gym now going to the gym everyday for a few minutes isnt that good right wow i feel like my ex-roommate all he ever did was study go to the gym and hang out with his girlfriend too i wonder what ill do for dinner tonight i should eat healthier learning how to actually cook a decent meal might help i hope i am doing this assignment correctly oh well if i am not i can just ask a ta just to make sure it is only been min and sec wow this is going to be longer than i thought oh look it is bloat a toy from mcdonalds that was in the movie finding nemo what a great movie that was best childrens movie ive seen in a long time i am feeling more ill now this cant be good maybe i shouldnt go out tonight ugh thats right- i wont be sleeping over tonight either because she cancelled on me so that her friend can sleep over oh well ive been spending a lot of time with her recently it is understandable i need to find some tissues theres a roll of paper towels and toilet paper i think ill grab some toilet paper hahaha- it is just like in elementary when we ran out of tissue boxes the teacher would sometimes have a roll of toilet paper sigh i miss those good old si ample days a lot less pressure and life was so relaxing back then it was good to be young i know what id like to do right now i want to play counter-strike too bad i cant install it onto her computer i wonder if whoever is going to read this knows who she is should be obvious so no worries what homeworkreading assignments do i need to take care of this weekend hmm i am taking care of this psychology writing assignment right now i still need to do that one experi ament which is being a pain since it keeps running into that error page and i cant go any further leb fin maybe a little cms reading i think that should take care of it oh wait- got to do the eco self-homework tomorrow look she is back aw she is tired from working out what she just told me how everyone has commented on my latest pictures on her board apparently people think it is a good picture of me i guess it is i actually like those pictures of me which is kind of rare i wonder if i can type like i do when i am online- grammatically incorrect that would speed up my typing look i am at minutes now is a great number all done now
as i look at my clock in the lower right hand corner it says am on september i am taking this time to reflect on the events that occurred to years ago they still should strike a painful memory in every americans life i remind myself to take nothing for granted because it could end at any unexpected moment i also feel a little stress with all of the homework that college brings along with it austin is so much different than my hometown of lubbock and it is taking me a while to get adjusted to it however i have absolutely loved the first three weeks of my tenure here so far i cannot wait to say that i am a graduate of the university of texas that will mean so much to me and my family since it will be an amazing accomplishment i just remembered that my laundry basket is full and i need to do that sometime before friday since i may be leaving town for a pat green concert hopefully the laundry room at the end of my floor th in jester west will not be full surely i can get caught up on all of my reading by this weekend and be able to enjoy it to the fullest without worrying about school homework that i did not complete i sure hope i can adjust to college as well as i have set my goals my roommates are out of the room right now and i am reminded how well it is to concentrate without them in here they are both from lubbock also and i have been friends with them for about years my parents called today and it is very i amportant to me to tell them how much i appreciate them paying for me to come down here i know it is hard on them to adjust to my absence but me and them know it is for the best i am convinced that the business program at ut will set me up for a very successful life my hands and forearms are starting to ache from typing continuously and my eyes are starting to close i feel like falling asleep but i know how much work i still have left to do for some reason i get most of my work done around or after midnight it helps that i dont have a class until on mwf and on tth i am looking forward to meeting some girls this weekend and possibly trying out a new church it is i amportant to me to find a church in austin and not forget the ways from which i was raised many people believe ut is so liberal that every student comes out weird but i believe there is something for everyone in austin i have already met so many people just like me and it is awesome by far i can tell that college will be the best time of my life the only thing i wish i could change is the dorm food i am getting so tired of chicken every meal i do not like oriental food or the hamburgers that they serve that basically li amit is it to chicken well the saying goes everything tastes like chicken anyways maybe next year i can get an apartment with some of the new people that i meet and possibly the guys from lubbock too i am trying to figure out why my email is not working it keeps making me re-log in and it is really getting annoying oh well two more days to the weekend arkansas comes in town this weekend so it should be a fun game i saw some of the football players today wow they are so huge they are like a different breed of people i want psychologists to study their genes and see how they get so big i know it is some sort of phenomenon or something i figured out that in minutes i have to find something new to do so i am already brainstorming i wish every paper was this easy english papers are so analytical and this is just what is on my mind it could go on forever i never have to stop and think dell what an amazing company how does someone without a college education make so much money i hope my college education will lead me to success like that well time is up
well first i am thinking that i should have done this a few days ago instead of on the last day there are still a few hours left but it is never good to procrastinate i guess it is ok because ive been very busy lately doing work for other classes i am usually in my dorm doing work instead of going to th street and getting drunk which is what i thought i was supposed to be doing some of my friends call me a hermit now because i am in my dorm doing work a lot of the times i dont really care id rather be responsible i do go out though yesterday i went with some friends to go watch a volleyball game now i am feeling full and satisfied because i just ate a pizza and i was extremely hungry i have not felt this satisfied in a while i dont really like most of the food in the cafeteria but the pizza is good i miss the food at home i miss home a lot i miss my family even though i talk to them over the phone just about every day it is just not the same when you are away life at home this summer was so si ample i was just in my house very comfortable and without worries i would go out with my girlfriend every few days i miss her desperately i think i was supposed to also describe what i am smelling i dont really smell anything right now i wish i could smell my girlfriends perfume again i think thats my favorite smell of all it is weird because i sometimes remember what the scent was i dont think thats supposed to happen now i am thinking that ive been typing too damn much and my hands are getting tired oh well it is in the name of science now i am thinking that someone might probably be reading this i feel sorry for whoever has that job sorry for writing this much sorry for not being very interesting now i am remembering that i missed the rain again i missed yesterdays rain because i was in my psychology class when i got out the ground was wet it happened again today on the count of my pre cal class now i am thinking that i probably should have done this thing on internet explorer instead of netscape because i think there should be a timer above this box thingy now i dont know when to stop i am probably going to stop too soon ill get an f in this assignment ill fail this class and be dropped then i wont be considered a full time student because i am only taking hours ill be forced to go home and i will go home a failure hmm that probably wont happen after all ive been having so much here even though it is away from all that i hold dear i think i have more minutes to go now i am feeling that i have to go take a leak dammit itll have to wait i am still not sure what this is for and what it studies maybe someone will read this and say that i am crazy that would be funny all i need is confirmation now i am thinking that my time would be better spent outside outside the air was cool and the sky was cloudy a very pretty day i hate being inside id much rather be outside i have a good view of the outside from my window i am on the seventh floor so it is pretty cool i think i am doing this wrong i am still not sure why i think my time is coming running out yup i am done

go back back back to the disaster i cant get that song out of my head it was so weird on courtneys board i couldnt understands what it meant till i read it out loud i wonder if spelling counts on this and if you can go back and correct mis spelled words like they care i am so bored but so excite about the job i have essentially been doing the same thing for the past three years and i think that i can handle the work load but this is college and it is suppose to be harder but so far it has not been i still need to read some of the info in the art history book that girl pre adviser said it would be fun but so far it has been a snooze feast what else to write about i though that i would have bad dreams after watching train spotting with the dead baby in the cradle but i really having been dreaming much probably because i stay up half the night hanging out with the hall everybody seems pretty nice and all the guy are hot especially matt oh baby but i think that he likes courtney everybody likes courtney she has that chicago accent and she pretty and nice i couldnt even get drunk guys to dance with me on saturday the only guy i danced with was p and then when steve said sorry to interrupt while we were dancing he said there was nothing to interrupt what a jerky think to say i mean i was standing right there it wasnt like he was drunk and didnt know what he was saying pritvi is funny but quite the little gossiper i really like my floor when they offer me a spot out side of supplemental housing i probably wont take i because i know so many people here and hopeful we can become good friends i have not had any real friends for the past few years i been so involved in school but the weekends were so boring with out a school activity to do i seen a movie with a group of kids twice one was after a school event and the other was after a church h think i saw movies that i didnt want to see and it was pretty much like any other movie ive seen by myself but i remember them better i only have ten more minutes left i like to count i am always counting things like yesterday i counted lance armstrong bracelets on the way to the theater building and seven on the was back courtneys doesnt count could i didnt see it on the walk i am so bored right now but i am going to be so busy with soccer broccoli project circle k and hopefully crew or rowing which sound the same to me but apparently with rowing you only have one ore and with crew you have two i dont know what else to right where is chris i so think that he forgot to knock on my door and just went off to lunch with courtney i cant believe he slept with jo i mean they had just met and a hour ago she had been kissing steven i mean if i was steven i would have been pissed what if all my thought were filled with profanity since i dont cuss i just thought about it constantly but i think cussing is stupid and you have to be a certain type of person to say certain words i sound so stupid when i cuss

i feel that i have so much to do in the next few days college is so overrated the few actual moments that you do have to go out and party and have a good time or do whatever it is that you like doing equal all the other times you are reading reading studying or doing other school stuff i had a french vanilla cappuccino at like tonight and it gave me so much energy that i cant sit and focus on one thing it seems that i have been procrastinating all night oooh all that i need is you so the song i am listening to right now but anyways now i dont remember what i was thinking about a moment ago it must be that caffeine i am not really used to but have consumed so much of it in the last hours o no i am not really sure what i just did i hit tab because thats what you do to indent but it hit the finish button instead so instead of having a stream of conscious thought for minutes i think it was more like so now i am thinking about how i need to get in contact with the ta or the professor and explain how i will probably have two submissions but i am not really sure because i dont know how computers work they are so complex i dont really understand them like earlier i couldnt log into the prescreening experi amental stuff i have put off the computer oriented stuff to later because in a way it scares me because i dont really trust them i am very skeptical of them i feel like if i start something the computer has a mind of it is own and is going to do whatever with it like just now i am panicking because the stupid machine is making an awful whirling twirling noise the song i am listening to is sung by a different group but the same song i did a trio to two years ago and it is bringing back memories of practicing and performing during a heavy practice time i had mono i remember kind of a cool time because i got to miss almost two weeks of school but the makeup work wasnt fun but i did get to know my teachers well that year i wonder how the other two girls that i did the trio with are doing they are both a year older than me so theyve been doing this whole college thing longer speaking of long i just looked at the time and ive only been doing this for like five minutes looking at the clock and counting down the time reminds me of times during drill team practice after school when they seemed to drag on forever i made it a goal to not look at the clock so hopefully the time would pass by faster but of course it didnt i actually saw a girl from my drill team this weekend she is a choreographer for a dance team i was interested in trying out for but i decided not too because it brought back to many memories i am thinking about trying out for steel dance this weekend but i dont know yet o yaw that reminds me that i need to email one of the girls on the team and ask her what the dress code for the clinic is because i really dont want to wear pink tights and a black leotard it makes me feel fat which reminds me i never ate dinner tonight and it is like i guess all the julius chips and salsa i ate will have to do thank goodness for julio he makes some awesome chips i wonder who julio is or even if julio is still alive my roommate brought his chips back from del rio my hippo something we learned about in class today must be working hard because it is bringing back many memories i think ill remember the name of it well or not the name more the function of it because my boyfriend has a horrible memory and we always joke about being big like hippos and stuff so i definitely will remember that one o look more remember things i guess the hippo thing is working right now the song i am listening to reminds me of two girls on my drill team rachel and shea they were awesome dancers i wonder where they are now there is a girl in my architecture design class that reminds me of shea the way she looks and talks actually shea has a pair of my comfy pants that i loved that my friend brittney had on tonight shea is in utah so i dont think i will ever see them again speaking of comfy clothes i wonder why all i wear to class now are soffe shorts and a t-shirt it must be that whole college thing o no here goes again that whirling noise and now my instant messenger signed on when i didnt even click on the program this computer is so random maybe i just need to update the ai am program but then again i dont know that much about computers so i am not really sure how id go about doing that with my luck id probably download some computer virus with it too and viruses that thing about getting sick when you are most stressed i will probably be getting sick soon because i am feeling very stressed right now although a huge weight was lifted off my shoulder today when we turned in a major project which didnt go exactly how i hoped but it is over so i dont want to think about it if i say i am going to get sick will my body start thinking that and make it iself sick that is something else we learned about if you start thinking one thing you can convince yourself of it o man i dont remember the name of it i am really going to have to study for this test i should probably start this weekend well there is one more thing to add to my to do list i started one earlier and it just keeps getting longer i need to add that i need to talk to a ta for this class and then email that girl from steel dance before i forget my minutes is up now it is a good thing i ended with that to do list so maybe since it is the most recent thing i will remember now i really like this song it is from going on that movie i have started watching more movies since i got to college i think that is what i will ask for for my birthday-movies o yaw my time is up i need to get ready for bed so maybe i will get a decent amount of sleep tonight

i really miss desiree she is my best friend and it hard not being able to talk to her everyday seeing as how i dont have my cell phone here with me my not so intelligent sister was supposed to send it to me in the mail saturday but how much do you want to bet that she didnt send it until monday and i wont get it until thursday before i leave to go to houston i am drawing a blank how am i supposed to write for twenty minutes when i am struggling to think of something to write after only two i guess i shouldnt think so hard should i is that supposed to be a question mark anyway i am really enjoying this psychology class i thought that it might have been boring but as luck would have it pennebaker is actually a really energetic professor i like that it almost seems as if he can relate to his students on a deeper level but at the same time he is still able to get his lesson across to us kind of reminds me of brink my science teacher in high school he has been there for quite some time now and he never ceases to amaze his students with his ability to connect with us i do not know one person in cleveland high school or one person who came through chs and had brinkley that didnt like hi am or his approach to teaching i miss hi am i miss high school college life is really overwhelming at times right now i am pretty much struggling to stay in school and let me tell you that it is not easy i partied way too hard last semester and it would be a shame for me to go home and have to endure the horrible comments from everyone oh nikki couldnt handle that big school she got the big head and got shot down as soon as she got there look at little miss i am smarter than you back in cleveland i guess it was lonely up there on her high horse i have to be a success and that is why i have buckled down on my studies and reading this semester it is so i amportant that i become somebody i cant stress that enough i refuse to go back home and end up on the same path that the rest of my family has chosen for themselves it is not easy living up to others expectations when you know that you can do it but arent sure if you know how or if you have the drive to do so my family is a bunch of nobodies and i hate to say that well in an educational sense of the term none of them went off to school in order to better themselves but then again i cant really blame them for that i mean we really dont have the resources required to be true leaders or successes when coming from an educational stance i am here on financial aid as it is it is not easy walking in my shoes some people think i have it so easy but they really have not idea what kind of challenges i had to overcome to get here it was not an easy road to tow i been through it all and still have managed to survive only by the grace of god speaking of god i miss tj and trinity and tristan i only wish that i had more time with them before they left especially tj he was and still is my baby i love hi am and miss hi am so much but his psycho parents took hi am away from me they could have left but why hi am i remember there being a time when he would not even go to them when i first started working in the nursery and how he could only say no that was my little boy i love hi am and miss hi am like you would never understand or maybe you would because i am sure you have kids and even though he wasnt mine i loved hi am like he was
the rtf usenet site is a piece of garbage i just sent my first required message only to have another persons name in the from slot now i probably wont get credit and worse yet i cant access it again the computers here suck it is bad enough i wait in line just to use one well thats it i have got to get my own or perhaps bring my old one from home it seems different even though basically everything is the same it is on my desk at home right now that antique desk where i spent hour after hour perfecting my work listening to my favorite music right now i hear journey and string right now now if that stereo down the hall would shut up what are they paying for anyway they come miles upon miles after earning the right to be here and then squander it on stupid sound effects and loud music if i wanted to hear inspector gadget during the si ampson’s i would change the channel i only get to watch t v for minutes or so a day and i certainly want to choose and if my roommate and i dont choose why should that inconsiderate shmuck down the hall get to speaking of halls that turn was so tight in the one off of my computer room i used to feel plush carpet under my feet and the cold refreshing taste of coke when i walked quickly into the room to begin my work for the night and all those shows that i missed i missed countless mindless hours of television pure mind-numbing entertainment what can beat that i see industrial carpet on the wall right now how plush my bed was jake used to love when i gave hi am nip or scratched his ears at night it reminds me of when that bumpkin exterminator came to the large clean inviting house thought he was a bob cat so the vet called hi am big-boned that doesn’t mean he was obese so he ate bowls a day and was a pound cat with a gut that reminds me of cats when the twenty pounder is the human equivalent of or so pounds that theatre rocked i m pei is awesome but that other guy on t v is an eccentric freak the myerson is cool i could go for some more hot chocolate now just like during the christmas musical we went to that guy was pretty short who my mom worked with and bald as a bowling alley floor i have to play pool before i go insane that basement used to smell musty but the sleepovers were fun
i like the idea of doing class assignments over the www it is much easier i think someday all assignments and teaching will be done through a web of interlinked computers students will sit at home in the same spot every day and fulfill their college requirements without ever seeing a professor or fellow student i would not like that however something would be lost without the direct personal lectures a person telling me something with a unique style and delivery leaves a greater i ampression on me than any computer text ever could i feel like i am sticking with this subject too long i am thinking with too much structure but i think that is the way i am before i communicate whether by typing on a computer or talking to someone i usually have a solid idea of what i am going to say i dont usually have spontaneous outbursts or a direct communication of a free flowing consciousness i hear someone whistling in the hall hes probably an active who will make me clean some mess up oh well wow i reached the second line i just figured this entire submission would be one never ending line of text like some huge sentence that rambles on and on and says nothing isnt that ironic i have something in the back of my head that says all this writing is just meaningless rambling but if this is an exercise to allow my free flowing mind to be translated onto paper that would mean that what i am thinking is just meaningless rambling it is always like that my mind just jumps from random thought to random sensation this chair isnt too comfortable at light speed no matter how fast i write i dont think i could ever capture the zany random chaotic and highly elusive thoughts that tickle my neurons for a millisecond then become forgotten in the same instant but if they become forgotten how do i know about them i wonder what ill do tonight i am not sure at all it is one of those times when i could have fun doing anything i might i dont know it doesnt even matter i dont know what else to write i am at a loss maybe by brain just hopped down a frequency i just went from the i amaginative sort of colorful thought chord you know the kind you get when you read a good sci-fi book to a superficial lethargic tone i feel like a cave man the only thing my mind says right now is food thank you
i wanted to write about something traumatic that happened to me because apparently traumatic experiences and how to deal with them is a pretty big fandango in this class something just happened though so i want to write about that and see where it takes me in the next nineteen minutes or so the computer assistant in the theatre department where i am right now being a theatre major and all just compli amented me on my hat a black fedora i bought in greenwich village about a year and a half ago i was visiting for about a week over spring break and auditioning for the elusive experi amental theatre wing of nyus tisch school of the arts after a fairly successful audition i concentrated all of my efforts of exploring something i had done about seven or eight months earlier the first time i visited this time i was alone though the time before i had my brother eighteen months my junior and my closest friend at my side and all was well this time i had to wait a couple of days for his arrival since he couldnt get off school and i could being a senior and having a few excused absence college days on my hands so i set out to explore and found a bar in the mob district of little italy that didnt id and i found myself drunkenly wandering the streets of new york stumbling upon strawberry fields in a haze and not realizing the significance until about a week later after three days of being lost in my drugged little haze my brother joined me when i picked hi am up at the airport i noticed that i had taken to thinking of myself as a new yorker i had adopted the city and there was a definite change in the way my brother and i related to each other this changed over the next four days though as he assi amilated into new york the way i had and we set out to little italy to begin our evenings with a little pasta a nat king cole i ampersonator a jug of white wine every night and a restaurant owned by the mob after taking in as much of the culture and the underbelly of the city we found ourselves down to our last having just dropped twenty bucks on some thai food that smelled like sewer filth it was our second to last day in the city and we decided to thrift store shop and try to extend our dollars as far as they would go then we saw them in a small shop in the village not that there arent a billion of them we both saw fedoras that just said you we ended up dropping our last fifty dollars on our new hats and had to pay for our ride to the airport a li amo surprisingly cheaper than a taxi because it had a set fare with a handful of quarters we hadnt eaten for two days and there wasnt a meal of any kind on the plane not even peanuts so we wound up in houston on a two hour layover with nothing to do empty stomachs and no money i ended up begging trying to sell a stack of demo tapes i had cut for two bucks a pop i ended up selling two and we ate the best taco bell that has ever been eaten by a human i remember that the only people who bought the tapes were other musicians maybe it is a karma thing wow that guy looks pathetic better buy his tape because that could be me someday one way or the other they understood i was upset just because my plan was to randomly hand out this stack of tapes to people as they departed for different corners of the country hoping that they would like it and that underground distribution would abound maybe it worked i still dont know i know it was passed around quite a bit in south texas but not much further than that oh well by the by i am really tired right now because my band played a two hour show last night we have not played that long in about a year since clubs usually li amit you to an hour or less we used to go two hours without even trying when we were playing for our friends parties but now weve gotten lazy last night really woke us up i was so drenched in sweat that i actually had to wring out my shirt after the show we didnt even get a decent crowd until the last thirty minutes or so thats ok better things will come along soon enough we play every thursday at black cat which has no cover and is all ages for some reason this alone does not attract a crowd it is really upsetting i know were not a bad band so it is really frustrating when you cant talk people out of disco dancing at bob popular to enjoy a free show that accepts all ages and doesnt involve a dj someday about that traumatic experience about five months ago i was hit by a car while i was crossing the street into trudys off guadalupe it was late and i was wearing all black and the guy didnt see me i was looking the other way because i saw the car that hit me but he seemed too far away to reach me i was more concerned about cars coming from the other direction which is a curving road that is hard to see down when he hit me his fender shattered my leg and i was thrown onto his windshield he didnt brake until then and the force of hi am braking as i hit the windshield sent me flying into the road about twenty feet out i never lost consciousness and never really felt all that dazed or affected by it i just calmly looked up announced that my fucking leg was broken and asked one of my friends to call then i just lay down in the road waiting for the ambulance it started to rain that night i was taken to brackenridge and left alone for about an hour at a time in the er only one of my friends cam to visit me she held my hand while they pieced my leg back together and set it into a cast they had already pumped me with morphine and i heard them mumble about amputation a time or two but eventually they settled on inserting a rod from my knee to my ankle the morphine did nothing to me though because they gave it in light doses and after years of recreational drug use i wasnt really affected that and the pain was coming from the one part of my body where intravenous drugs couldnt possibly go i ended up just biting down on a folded-up blanket not wanted my screams to disturb others in the er over the next three days i was observed and recovered quicker than anyone i amagined my family came to be with me from san antonio except for my dad who was in orlando on business he wanted to rush to austin to be with me but i didnt want hi am to see me tied up to machines and weak i knew he couldnt handle it after about a half hour of coaxing he stayed in orlando he has not had a drop of alcohol in twenty years after getting a kidney removed before i was born that night he drank hi amself into submission slowly my friends from the theatre department began creeping in until i had a steady stream of visitors and a room full of flowers candy and porn dont ask the faculty came to make sure that i was alright something i never wouldve expected and one night my nurse a mary poppins sort of woman turned my bed so that i could see the tower lit up in orange ive never had school spirit or pride in any organization whatsoever but for some reason i cried for some reason i loved the sight of the tower at that moment ive recovered completely i was angry for a while and spent a lot of time screaming and damning anyone who could walk while i made my way around in a wheelchair i marveled at the fact that even when i was on crutches nice families at the arboretum would still pull their children closer and hold their purses tighter i began to keep a journal but by the time i had written five entries my anger was gone my depression was gone i couldnt even dwell of death which i know i had cheated i was just glad to be alive and to put it all behind me now i am physically and emotionally recovered i dont have nightmares and i dont fear cars i dont know why maybe ill learn that this semester for some reason i recovered very nicely in all aspects from this whole awful little episode the good thing is that i am happy and sober now i had attempted suicide twice this past year once just two weeks before the accident then i was put in a situation where i didnt try and death actually came for me and i fought to stay alive thats always struck me as odd oh well for whatever reason i am a happier if quieter person things are good i am looking forward to psychological experi aments this year now i am off ive written for about thirty minutes and i think it is time for a cigarette bye bye now
yeah ive finally gotten around to doing this assignment i hope i do o k oh whoops i forgot to check my watch to see when i need to stop o k it is so i will stop at i just double spaced at the end of that period i remember learning how to do that in my th grade computer class oh gosh what if this is too short i am a really slow typer but this is really fun the girl next to me is typing so fast maybe i will be that good by the end of this year there is a boy now walking around with a blank expression on his face i wonder where he is going after this i am going to my room and working on some homework i like how the keys on this computer feel when i type i miss my computer at my house but anyway this is fun because i am so used to typing in an organized fashion where everything is structured i mean this assignment is structured but our writing doesnt have to be my left eye itches but i am afraid you touch it because i dont want to waste any time on my assignment my watch just beeped which means that it is now and i have ten minutes left wow a loud buzzer just went off maybe someone messed up a computer or something someone just rattled his change which reminds me that i have only a little bit of money left for the week i hope i am writing enough this is as fast as i can go i wonder if you really read these or just ski am through them it said this was a completion grade good ill work on the other assignment tomorrow afternoon the line now for waiting has gotten really long thank goodness it is air-conditioned in here my left eye still hurts and is making me blink i wonder what the others in here are working on i wonder what my parents are doing right now they are probably both already at home i hope they find a place to stay for parents weekend gosh that sounds so freshman i only have more minutes left there is no way the teacher reads all of these the t a must help i like scott i went to one of his study sessions my nails are long and i wanted to get a manicure i wonder how many in the class have finished this assignment typing is very therapeutic i feel a lot more relaxed now i hope ive typed enough the girl next to me is leaving i have minutes left i just checked my watch i am kind of sleepy i think i will go to bed early tonight yeah tonight david letterman is on hes my favorite oh my time is up ill be back tomorrow to work on the next homework
hello you wonderful people who are reading my paper i hope you really really enjoy this one after all the other ones you have read anyway right now i am really excited because i am just about to go to the rage against the machine concert i am hoping that i have a blast and i know i will my brother and a lot of my friends came up for this concert so i will be able to see them aint that the greatest thing earlier today i was wishing that i could fly the reason for that is that we were stuck in traffic just think about it just flying through the air your hair flying back brushing across your face--but i guess if we could fly we would not think that much about it yesterday i got an e-mail from my sister it was really cool and all and she should come visit me soon my sister is the one person in my family that i really enjoy--but enough about that i am going to a concert and to party oh just to throw something in here i was noticing that many people here get really excited about going out and staying out till whatever time in the morning i think this is really hilarious because i come from laredo texas that is a border-town to mexico not that it could be canada in texas well we have clubs and discos in mexico that are just a few minutes away so i am use to going out staying out late and drinking therefore i came to the conclusion that most of the people here have not been able to go out and have fun during their high school years--whether this is attributed to their parents or themselves that is why there is such a high drop-out rate here in ut and why a lot of students struggle just to pass i hope pass all my classes with as if possible i am planning to be a plastic and reconstructive surgeon and i kind of need a great gpa to get into med school oh by the way i want to clear up the reason why i want to be that kind of a surgeon many people believe that plastic surgeons are doctors who are just in the business for money some people dont even consider doctors as real doctors they are seen as individuals who help superficial people stay young and beautiful although plastic surgeons may do this they help build up the self-esteem of the patient there are some people who were born with defects or were in a really bad accident plasticreconstructive surgeons help these people enter the world again most people with some type of defect usually have a low self-esteem therefore they do not really enjoy life nor do they participate in daily activities with other people plasticreconstructive surgeons allow these people to enter into the world they feel better about themselves and as a whole their spiritual self is i amproved this is vital to the survival of the individual--for without it there is nothing to live for well i am going now hope i didnt bore you too much >
i wish i had a car though but i think that will bug me for a while because itll probably be a while until i can afford one but i will always get by i know well it appears that laundry day is tomorrow so i still have to wake up at am even though i have no classes till three but then again thats probably why it is laundry day well i didnt get to talk to my girlfriend tonight because she was in class late but at least shes at class thats good because she needs to go to class as often as possible to pull up her gpa so maybe just maybe she can come to austin and live somewhere around here i wonder if whoever reads this will ever understand why people ramble anyway ill call her tomorrow to see how her first day at community college is it is pretty nice in my appt right now a cool degrees which is nice after having to carry about pounds of groceries up a hill and up a flight of stairs just kept on saying can you feel that to keep myself from stopping because once you stop you just might not be able to start again i guess thats the focus to my whole life not sure if thats good or bad or what probably what got me in trouble last semester when i was half way thru the semester pretty crazy that i am my worst enemy but in a way i guess that makes me my best friend except for my girlfriend and real best friend of course but if i didnt kick my own butt to do better who would so i just keep on chugging i dont know why i am so success driven lord knows id like to be able to loosen up a bit and have some fun but i never can seem to do that try alcohol to do that but pretty sure my body didnt take too much of a liking to that oh well ill probably grow out of it please please please so enough of that i hope the aggies have lost against fsu because then i get to email my ag friends and laugh but then again that might not be the greatest idea if the horns dont fair that well this year dont know what i am listening to on the radio now oh yea acdc rock on anyway i loved that howard stern movie not quite sure why but you almost have to love someone that pathetic movies thats a topic i love going to see movies just like the escape i guess thrillers are the best not the goory sp ones but like the one with kevin spacy usual suspects that movie was great also that pri amal fear was terrific saving that line for the last was brilliant technique and the acting superbe i was getting all sorts of recommendations from the guy at blockbuster this past friday yes i was a pathetic party pooper but i did manage to do some socializing anyway i get these movies and come home now i am already disappointed because i have this great new tv in my living room and no cable hookup to watch anything but fox thru a lot of colored snow so i figure ill rent a movie that has to get reception but noooooo the vcr is goofed or something it may have something to do with the tracking but i dont have the tape anymore so i cant experi ament i am usually very good which technical things i knew everything about my first vcr before it came out of the box but last friday was definately not my day triple low ive heard it called but oh well my friends liked my spaghetti and my moms sauce so that was good not a complete loss man i would hate to be the person trying to pick stuff out of this so anyway i have minutes or so to type i have a printer sitting next to me still in it is box and a vacuum cleaner in it is box in the closet tell you anything about me actually i am a pretty neat ship keeper i do have a bit of a paperwork mess in my bedroom but the livingroom is quite presentable except of course for a big big like really large and at one time really heavy tv box but until the cable guy comes on wed itll probably stay there i have to make sure that i can support my mother beginning this summer because i think she may need it at some point wish i had a godsent car that would work and then i could probably swing insurance payments and gas but with car payments itd be too much oh my listening to eye of the tiger how old is that so maybe i should just go to sleep after writing this i need to go see if i can to the pretesting for this class but i tried before this and couldnt get it to load up something about the server being down well such is life i think i should do pretty good this semester shooting for a again got to stay in head of my brother we are so competitive hes a yr behind me but transfered in with a bit more credit than i did and with leaving mid-semester last yr hes got a good chance to stay pretty close times up bye now
very rarely do i just sit down in front of a blank screen and start writing without having any idea where my words are going at this point i am really wishing that i could get some peace and quiet ive always lived in an extremely quiet house and i guess i took the peacefulness for granted however despite the occasional clash between my study and the party in my room i have no complaints about the present state of my life i am heading home this weekend and while ive only been in austin for about two weeks i feel like this is home now my house is just like some place i visit on occasion i cant decide whether it is a good thing that this change in my life doesnt bother me or whether it is a bad thing either way what are you going to do i am just completely blanking on what to write about anything that is running through my mind would take too long to explain and i dont usually tell stories about myself anyway for an arbitrary subject i guess ill write about my best friend she goes to am and i will be seeing her in about a week for her sisters wedding it seems strange to be her without her we talked everyday in highschool four years thats a long time however i dont feel like our relationship has suffered at all because of the distance i always believed that once you got to see what is inside the center the someone what makes them tick what makes them unique then the relationship never ends because what is inside someone never changes all of the stuff we put on for show that changes but not whats inside people i am looking forward to the wedding though because it feels like i have not seen her in a long time o k second arbitrary topic dating i am really looking forward to dating in college i mean there are about new girls wandering around here and at least some of them are bound to be interesting however it is a bit strange to think about dating because it is only about month since i broke up with my last highschool girlfriend damn it is so hot in this room well my ex-girlfriend that subject is going no where i guess i have a tough time talking about the past i always figured that everyone distorts there versions of the past memories are either viewed through rose-colored glasses or blinders id rather think about what i am doing right now memories are nice on occasion but as with anything else you can over-indulge in them whats really foremost in my mind right now is making good grades and not losing my social life or mind in the process i really dont think that will be too difficult though when you study something you enjoy then it is not really work instead of draining your energy it gives you more energy new things to learn new things to strive for i love it i really have no clue how long ive been writing but i assume i am pretty close to minutes mental note to self pick up new pat green cd for dad tomorrow and call angela well this is my stream of consciousness it is not a deep stream but damn it it is mine to end i will remind myself of some sayings a very wise man said once never play poker with a man named doc never eat at a place called moms never date a woman with a tattoo of a dagger anywhere on her body never try to teach a pig to sing it stresses you out and annoys the pig and finally the ulti amate truth in the universe frogs have and always will whomp their asses every time they jump thank you ladies and gentlemen be sure to tip your waitress good night
