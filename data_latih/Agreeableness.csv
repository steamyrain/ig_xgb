agreeableness
well here we go with the stream of consciousness essay used to do things like this in high school sometimes they were pretty interesting but often find myself with lack of things to say normally consider myself someone who gets straight to the point wonder if should hit enter any time to send this back to the front maybe ill fix later my friend is playing guitar in my room now sort of playing anyway more like messing with hes still learning theres drawing on the wall next to me comic book characters think but not sure who they are is been while since kept up with comics just heard sound from icq thats chat program on the internet do not know too much about so cannot really explain too well anyway hope done with this by the time another friend comes over will be nice to talk to her again she went home this weekend for labor day so did my brother didnt go not sure why no reason to go guess hmm when did start this wow that was long line guess will not change later okay running out of things to talk about found that happens to me lot in conversation not very interesting person guess well do not know is something working on in class now that might help the phone just rang should get the guy playing the guitar answered for me is for my roommate my suitemate just came in and started reading this uncomfortable with that hes in the bathroom now you know this is really boring piece of literature never realized how dull most everyday thoughts are then again when you keep your mind constantly moving like this there is not really time to stop and think deeply about things wonder how long this is going to be think is been about ten minutes now only my second line how sad well not really considering how long these lines are anyway wonder what going to do the rest of the night guess theres always homework to do guess well see this seat is uncomfortable my back sort of hurts think going to have arthritis when get older always thought that wouldnt like to grow old not too old suppose always been very active person fear of growing old think guess itll go away as age gradually do not know how well id deal with paralysis from an accident though as long as god and my friends around ill be okay though pretty thirsty right now there is not much to drink around my room ultimate frisbee ivent played that all summer fun game but tiring out of shape id like to get in better shape but hate running is too dull for me hmmm is almost over now just few more minutes lets see if make to the next line short reachable goals whatever anyway what else do to do tonight guess could read some my shirt smells like dinner is pretty disgusting need to wake up for am class tomorrow remember when that was not early at all well made to the next line so proud of myself thats sarcasm by the way wonder if was suppose to right this thing as narrative oh well too late now time for me to head out until next time good bye and good luck do not know
stream of consciousness what should write about am supposed to have some kind of direction or am supposed to write exactly what thinking this feels like very strange assignment for homework seems that pretty easy actually would be pretty intense if this was worth more than however much is worth hmm for some reason blanked out and seems like thinking about nothing oh well lets see what happened today lucked out on my econ quiz was actually able to guess my way to what are the chances of that having faith definitely pays off always say that is important to have faith thats my motto in life have faith and have fun life is funny thing one minute your there and gone the next is like louie the lug mcgurg for example he died tragically at what happened somebody stepped on his fingers and that killed him well he was hanging of the th story of the hotel at the time poor lug no poor mrs the lug now she is on the streets selling apples the point is that the lug did not plan ahead and the government got everything oscar was damn intense movie seems very difficult to figure out what thinking wen try blank out and keep trying to figure out what stream of consciences then life is good this entire internet business is pretty cool never would of thought could write paper and then send to teacher by pushing submit button wonder how much longer will be writing this only have ten more minutes left everyone always asks what you are thinking about when you are just sitting there thinking usually you say nothing because you just do not want to tell them now trying to think of what thinking and getting nothing cricket is great sport there is going to be the sahara cup going to be played in canada is india vc paistan one of the biggest cricketing rivalries in the world team pak is going to be victorious aamir sohai is great cricketer can not believe that they dropped him from the team granted he was little out of form but he would have taken the indian crap bowlers around the park and back this is beginning to seem kind of silly hope that was your point wonder if any body is actually going to read this for some reason doubt whoever is reading though feel sorry for that is lot peoples garbage talk you have to read maybe is not no idea what is this screen is really weird how come only three lines have popped up been writing for minutes is this some kind of ploy so we can not see what we have written can not believe that only thought about that now in fact just noticed that only this much was on the screen very very interesting getting tired of typing waiting for these final minutes to tick away hope you gain something out of this because dont think will actually might but no idea how was thinking about quitting early but what if you had some kind of device that told you how long was on for that is actually pretty scary only god knows what technology can do nowadays anyway hope you enjoy reading this is quite possible that enjoyed writing it is fun and relaxing to write something without having go back and proofread seems like you are an expert typer actually anyway now my minutes are up so have faith and have fun if you read this give me an even though does not matter this completion grade stuff is amazing all my classes should do it

here sitting in the computer lab trying to track my thoughts thinking that shouldnt worry about what to think not exactly sure why this assignment is necessary but then again no psychologist whoa change in thought now thinking of england and of how wish could go there to see the sights and see close friend who lives there now sad because this reminds me of princess diana and of what wonderful woman she was was truly saddened when heard she died she was on of those people that you dream of meeting some day even if you are only around her for moment she was the type of person that could make your whole year just by smiling at you this sadness takes me to other places now simultaneously thinking of close friend of mine who is clinically depressed and of old friend of the family who was homosexual and died this year of aids christian and strong christian beliefs but when tragedy strikes those you love the most there is wonder and doubt involving supposed loving god sometimes praise god for the things he does but other times you ask yourself why always been dreamer setting my goals high but sometimes wonder if what want to do with my life is right or if god wanted me to go off and become minister life is never simple but just try to roll with the punches minister of mine once said that some people build up barriers around themselves in order not to get hurt they try to experience the least amount of pain as possible by blocking themselves out but then he said that these same people cannot experience love very much at the same time as protecting themselves from pain they are limiting themselves to lesser degree of love then is possible want to be one of the people who can experience love greatly but in reality been hurt before and there are definite walls to protect myself from that kind of pain again whenever you go on date and you are nervous everyone says just be yourself think that is huge crock of shit multi faceted person do not even know what being myself would be is that the self that you express outwardly where in my case jovial and make people laugh or is that the self inside that has deep emotions and is very very sensitive and sometimes insecure while also being loving and caring sometimes feel like all of this love stored up inside of me and no one to give to try not to dwell in these places for any significannot amount of time think io like who but is just that really havent figured that out completely yet at first didnt know what to write but now glad we did this assignment is good to get your feelings out from inside when you do not want to tell anyone and you do not have diary bye-bye
well was little worried about using the internet because never used before used e-mail last year little but for the most part this is whole new experience to me today has been good day really enjoy my monday and wednesday class schedule except for the fact that do have to get up at but that is actually good thing because my day is done at am and the rest of the day to do primarily whatever want little worried about the amount of stress that college has been is entirely not that bad because do tend to be organized person and good with managing my time although do have to admit the reason why has probably been so hard to get back on track this year is because my senior year in high-school got that little thing called senioritis was hoping to be able to do this assignment from my computer in my dorm room but the communications company has had hard time getting my ethernet link set up this is kind of nice though coming to the undergraduate library and getting acquainted with their systems not decided what going to do this weekend because is one of my really good high-school friends birthday and she is going to school at am university so therefore lot of my friends are going to go down to college station and surprise her really want to go but want to stay here and go to the football game that is if get date which as of now do not have one but in sorority here on campus and we have mixer tonight with fraternity so maybe will get lucky and someone will ask me anyhow though these little events such as mixer kind of make me uncomfortable because my boyfriend goes to school at louisiana state university and is strange trying to interact with other guys well think completely said that wrong is not hard at all to interact with the opposite sex but we decided mutually that we needed to try and date other people and not stay completely focused on someone who is hours away anyhow this is really strange this assignment because keep getting this urge to go back and re-word what just said do realize the point of the assignment and that is not what matters really hoping that great first semester at college already enjoying tremendously but little nervous about the academics my father will not allow me to bring my car up here until my grades have proven worthy as he says thought that was going to be big deal but everywhere you go is within walking distance so truly doesnt matter well just glanced at my watch and has been minutes so will be going back to my room now
his time at the lab listening to everyone in here typing and some coughing as well the laser printer doesnt seem to stop printing at the communications computer lab doing this assignment wondering whether or not will be going home dallas next week on friday hoping my friend will take me also hope can bring back my sister who is presently in dallas so that she can live with us that way do not have to worry about cooking or getting food for dinner glad my pre calculus professor gave me permission to take my midterm on monday the day after get back from dallas--if go just looked at the proctors they are helping some people out with their passwords wish could get job as proctor think that would be an easy way of getting some money most of them do not even know what they are doing just thought about my major hope can get into the texas creative department in advertising that would be really neat since like to do stuff like that just read that lot of students in advertising have earned awards but just looked at some of their work and do not think would be all that hard to do just looked at my watch about fifteen more minutes before can send this message lot of people are leaving the lab know that stinks wish their was better computer when got here right now stuck with this old ibm comp --the only one in the lab thats still using windows wish was home with my family right now especially since they left for denver today if only didnt have school right now then could live at home and help my dad with our family business lot of these computers in here are down sure would help if someone would fix them jesse holman jones--so thats who this building is named after who is he never heard of him the sign on the wall says lumberman banker publisher statesman what does that have to do with communicationsexcept publisher still have to do my rough draft for english oh well will probably do tonight when get home not like can get any work done their my brother is too loud and annoying he doesnt let me study in peace he is pretty stubborn--likes to have everything his way just because my parents arent here he thinks hes my guardian or something wish lived in dorm instead that would have been cool that way could have met new people and friends not only that is right there on campus and they have cafeterias that would help lot now only have six minutes to go this thing is taking pretty long time if werent for this assignment could have been working on my english paper right now hope that paper turns out good at least my professor liked my proposal-he said did an excellent job in class he was saying how rare that case would be hopefully ill do well in this class really do not like english classes their so boring all you do is discuss lot of things write papers and practice grammar thought my english class would be very large instead ends up having only people hate small classes at least all my other classes have over one hundred people well done guess will send now
the moment sitting in my room enjoying oz slurpee cherry and coke mix which is my favorite been relaxing after another crummy cafeteria meal thinking about the days occurrences tuesdays and thursdays are rough because to go to class all day classes arent really that bad but they seem to put large strain on the mind making body feel worn out the course load for me this year is tuff and seems that little free time left this is very strange assignment in my mind cannot see what yall can get from hearing me ramble on about nothing but if helps then guess is worth chapter two in the psy book is very interesting in fact found the course to be interesting to bad comes after an hour and half of chemistry and the most boring class ever been in the selection of girls in the class is not bad either so an interesting class combined with good looking scenery is big plus in my book whoa brain freeze damn hate those well after this to start on my homework now that is one hard class that one and chem are going to be the death of me this semester seems like minute free flow writing assignment seems like would be hard but once you start just seems to flow kind of like good rap song really like rap the combination of good beat and master on the microphone to me is really fine music however love oldies too the beatles mommas the pappas the monkeys and so on are really good listening music kind of like returning to my roots guess well that was twenty minutes so ill shut up now hope this was enough to fulfill your requests
well finally made to the computer lab of course waited until the last minute now that figured out how to get in here will not be so hard tomorrow hope can get done tomorrow by because only have an hour between classes so happy that got out of my class early today gives me time to study other things think did fairly well on my quiz but who knows should have gone to work today feel little guilty for leaving when did but show up and they arent even there what am supposed to do just stand out in the hall like an idiot this job is waste of my time they never have anything for me to do anyway wish could quit but cannot because mom is friends with linda and need the money especially now because of the car situation swear don is just being big baby about the whole thing hope not in bad mood this weekend will be nice to just relax without having to go out hope my dinner turns out ok wally might be sorry he asked me to cook for him need to call him tonight for his birthday hope the package he got was either from his mom or dad cannot believe he didnt get card from either of them last year know he was upset about that but of course he would never admit that to me is too bad sometimes that cannot talk to him about everything like last night know he didnt know what to say when called but just kept thinking that if had been talking to rica or renee they would know how to handle the situation better but what can expect hes just guy hes told me before that he doesnt handle the mushy stuff very well at least he listens to me glad had the chance to talk to genia yesterday really do feel bad about not visiting her but knew was best for everyone if we didnt see her at least she doesnt live here anymore think that would be bad situation really hope she gets over him soon shes been sad too long and is just not doing her any good completely run out of things to say and that doesnt happen to me very often unfortunately is happening more often really love here at ut but is incredibly lonely see thousands of people everyday but still lonely guess thats why on the phone for so long every night need to feel connected to my friends even if do not see them as much as used to unfortunately on the phone so much that do not get much studying done is alot different than high school never had to study in high school now so behind and do not know if ill ever get caught up guess when done with this ill go study until my next class which happens to be psychology thought this was supposed to be lesson in stress relief well this assignment has given me nothing but headache speaking of headaches cannot seem to get rid of mine is either stress or allergies either way suffering well finally done so guess this is it
right now tired and thinking about going to bed imagine what my classes will be like in thew morning and that to get up at to be ready on time for my astronomy class think if any home work or stuff that to have done for class then think of my next class which is psychology think if any preparation need to do for that class then think about what gonna eat for breakfast and then for lunch then think that need to go to the microcenter to get the software need for my business classes disrupted by one of my friends who call me on icq talk to him for few minutes and then get back to writing then immediately receive phone call and talk on the phone for about min then begin to worry how long been typing for and try to remember when started feel that is time to go to bed so decide to submit the assignment

why does this keep going to the left instead of down space at the end of each line prof pennebaker as sit in this library cannot help but notice the pleasure get from the quietness is the same feeling get from sitting in park or on golfcourse perhaps even in bookstore the quietness provides my mind with an escape from the everyday world of horns traffic jams and yelling from this feeling my mind seems to work on smoother track with less obstacles to overcome before can finish complete thought if the world was in complete silence at all times or perhaps even if were deaf believe would be wiser and would be able to formulate thoughts easier does this mean that deaf people actually have an easier time getting by in the world or is their inability to communicate too much of burden maybe this is whats wrong with todays world communication lines are so mixed up due to language barriers and different types of slang that the world is like one large deaf fishbowl in that case deaf people would have an easier everyday life because they would be minus the struggles we all go through with communication if communication were an easy things and we all saw eye-to-eye on all issues achieving things such as world peace business agreements and compromises would be no big deal where did the communication lines go wrong why did humanity branch out into hundreds of different languages and tongues when one universal language could have eliminated so many problems the answer to that will most likely never be found this girl sitting to my right is awfully attractive but cannot muscle up the courage to talk to her is once again the problem of communication or does this have to do purely with lack of courage would like to think is communication problem but that would probably be just lame excuse for not talking to her of course is lack of courage although know she will not bite my head off slap me ignore me or flat out dis me still am too much of coward to begin conversation with her what if she knew what was thinking right now would she be flattered embarrassed insulted or just flat out shocked guess ill never know unless ask her we both know that is not going to happen because weve already established that acting like coward right now no big deal there are plenty of fish in the sea wow cannot believe how fast twenty minutes just went writing without structure is lot more enjoyable then writing with and as they say time flies when youre having fun
really cool being able to see all of my friends and hang out yet feel like somewhat out of place was really strange coming home yesterday as soon as we came into town felt like was in some kind of mirage was like was dreaming and still feels that way really need to do lot of homework but do not think going to get whole lot done considering the circumstances went to our high school football game last night wow was that strange saw some old friends and just felt so strange is going to be even worse going back because now that seen everybody somewhat want to stay but on the other hand need to go back have to go back and do want to go back met people and still want to meet more people had lot of fun down there and so want to go back too much homework now uhhh that sucks well the ut football game is on and theyre already losing guess is ucla but come on guys oh well guess supposed to be talking about my college experience so anyway do not know getting adjusted pretty well to the university love the campus absolutely love the buildings especially in the six pack and with the view of the capital and the tower is just amazing from dallas and the austin area is just so much nicer and feel so much safer theres not lot of places like that up here but seems like everywhere in austin is like that been down to the river and it is so much better than our river up here the trinity and the lakes in austin are so clean and nice plus theres so much to do which is also somewhat of bad thing since is harder to get my work done with so much going on something that does seem really weird is that can actually study better in my dorm room than could in my own room here at home guess because realize that in college paying for my education so taking lot more serious cannot screw around now and actually do find myself wanting to learn surprise actually sit in class and listen to the professor lot more respect for the teachers down here because know that they know what theyre talking about and want to learn more the whole is experience is so much different and better than high school in my opinion coming back home and seeing friends still in high school feel sorry for them high school was fun and all but college is fun and feel getting quality education plus in high school theres way too many people who just do not want to be there and they have to act so stupid for some reason and was just extremely annoying in college everyone whos there is there because they want to be there so theyre arent people who just want to cause trouble and act stupid all the time food what is the deal with the food at jester mean some of is good but the main course is always terrible is cold and looks like something has infested but to be fair there is some good food every once in while home food now theres big difference mmm got to love thats got to be the best thing about coming home at least one of them also not having to worry about money is great thing getting along great with my roommate had heard about all of these horror stories about roommates so was little worried at first but usually get along with most everybody so figured would probably be ok and was hes normal and listens to the same music as me were getting to be pretty good friends the only thing worried about now is the tests everyone keeps telling me that no matter how much study some times ill still fail that worries me would like to think that if know the material then would pass the test and so far really havent had that much homework to do had to read lot but ivent had much writing work to do think running out of things to talk about or rather think about but well is been twenty minutes and guess understand what this was all about plus the ut game is on and hopefully we can somehow with the grace of god pull off win think that may be impossible though so maybe then we can get some kind of close loss man we are getting killed oh well next week we get to play kansas st and theyre only like what th in the nation thats not so great right out defense just plain sucks mean do not think ever seen such bad plays as what seeing right now but hey weve got ricky though so maybe he can pull off some kind of miracle yeah is going to be one of those games that goes down in history because we came back and won there thats positive thinking think thats what the team needs the most and if football cannot do that great weve still got some other great athletes in some other great sports thats the great thing about ut weve got so many sports that somethings got to be good and love how theres like an organization for everyone so that everybody fit is in the organizations are great because they make you feel more at home youre able to be with people that you feel comfortable with ok is been like way past twenty minutes so guess through uh bye guess

friends keep me awake until ridiculously late hours and then are so inconsiderate as to wake me up early in the morning today for example my friend kevin woke me up around this morning after keeping me awake until in the morning and half hours of classes on this day not to mention bible study at and supposed to help clean up the erwin center for fund raiser after the shania twain concert do not think going to do that though as really need to catch up on some sleep at the same time though also excited to hear from my friend jaren in maine theres really weird story behind how we met as most people do nowadays was chatting online in one of the chatrooms this girl was the only one who didnt seem to lie about how pretty she is and how rich she is etc so had fascination with her from the beginning she actually sent me the private message first and asked where was from what do for fun what look like etc from that day on there hasnt been single day where we havent written each other after few months in fact we began calling each other on regular basis which didnt please my parents at all hehe know her better than her friends do which really gives me much pleasure we send each other pictures and were really open about what we do and stuff do not think ever kept anything from her and know she doesnt keep anything from me because she tells me things that she knows would upset me but she tells them anyway over these last few months grown to love her as girlfriend weird know well she feels the same about me and shes planning on visiting for the first time sometime this winter even get jealous when she talks about other guys which is really weird first of all because weve never met in person and second of all because she lives over miles away talking about her always reminds me of my other friend christina theres another funny story behind this relationship as well she was best friends with one of my good friends yoon well yoon liked this one guy named young and they always hung out together christina and this guy brian hung out with them too all the time well brian started to like christina and she detests him so she felt really uncomfortable alone with him one time she felt so awkward that she decided to call me even thought wed never met or talked before ever rather than have to talk to brian yoon gave her my number and told christina that was easy to talk to and to get along with well christina and ended up talking for over hours that night every night since then we talked on the phone every day for hours at time if was not for her wouldve averaged more than hours sleep day began to grow very fond of her as well got incredibly jealous when she dated my best friend allen he treated her like crap and that really upset me they broke up after month but because he was best friend couldnt ask her out was not sure what the consequences would have been she moved to california in early june and that was probably the most sad id ever been in my life few months before she left decided to tell her how felt and to my surprise she felt the same way about me that actually depressed me even more because passed up the chance to be with the girl wanted to be with most well things do not always work out the way you want them to one thing worried about right now has nothing to do with what been talking about is my car stereo many people think weird because this fascination with naming my possessions for example my car stereo cost over and named veronica my tennis rackets have names as well my favorite racket is called excalibur anyway famous for my stereo because not only does sound very nice but can shake your house from miles away hehe well my apartment that live in is not in the nicest of neighborhoods so been extra cautious about playing loud so that people will not know is in there last night though was showing off to one of my friends and forgot about group of who appeared to be gang members walked past my car and everyone of them was staring at my car heard stories about how many people got their cars broken into so was really scared at that moment always looking out the window when hear noise now is getting kind of ridiculous my roommate warned me about that but was too caught up in trying to show off to my friends can only hope that doesnt get stolen got huge headache right now too think is combination of several factors one is that ivent gotten any sleep another is that kind of sick right now feeling little light headed is also very hot in this house try to take naps after class but had absolutely no time today but at least the weekend to look forward to my eating habit is have been rather unhealthy as well too much fast food and going out is showing too around the gut that is some

ok thinking about old school nintendo man those were the days my friend ryan had lot more game than did but did not meet him till th grade and until then though had lot of games which guess is saying your happy with what you got till some on else gets more than you and then jealousy sets in but id like to think grown somewhat sense then remember science tech class used to take in th grade all years go back to almost everything has some tie in my mind to do not know why and pops up very often is like velma from scooby do all cartoons go back to velma guess youd have to see cartoon network to understand thinking of my mom is odd but sometimes worry that she worries too much about me she was really overprotective but very loving and now still have feelings like hatred for being held back by her over protectiveness so whenever we are together try to make sure she doesnt think turned out goo because some how still feel grudge against her methods and think missed out too much when was little nnnnnnnnnnnn captain that was cool cartoon hmmm wonder caryn is around or selena they are kind of friends of my best friend so kind of awkward but think they really like me more than deserve because ryan always says things to them about me and well id like to get to know them better but awkward because he was friends with them first reorganized my room this ear pretty cool something you just do not turn in for grade even if you think will not be read but just let be known thinking those things well enough of that what is on my mind the lawnmower man that doctor guy who look like gu from that x-files rip off kieger or something the at tem crack force of firearms specialist design to heighten an experience if cannot even understand now that was true stream of conscience lost complete control let me try again hotdogs mustard ice cream maybe hungry barbecue chips why the hell did just think of feminine hygiene product milk ducts cows chickened crunch superheroes dad comics pride going monkey zoo hen turkey target where work love in the zoo with oink hungry ran and bombings in libya contra scandal the president cool president like if only to be rebellious and also the kennedys stereotypical drinkers which will be partaking in he festivities to night but you know thats ok guess finally got that damned questionnaire filled out after thought had not saved because read when logged in again but guess was just being an ass do not like when ignored know act stupid and say silly things lot but oh well that guy joe next door is doing something damn think really want girlfriend again really sucks not being able to act straight around girls just have to stop being shy and be suave but less rryohoyoho pirates life for me and al can say is that the future is looking bright and got to got rrahhh rrahhh run away tommyboy is really good movie despite what people might say think really funny at lot of parts well looks like my time is running up so ill go tell no one or else will probably be embarrassed
probably will not get too much typed because type kind of slow anyway my girlfriend is not talking to me today actually started yesterday because she says that do not back her up whatever anyway lately we have been getting into lot of fights think she is only pmsing this time thought oh well ernie left his binaca on my desk he better leave today that boys got to go home actually typing kind of fast now johnnys pekkle is so dirty need to make more friends also need to call either jefferson or james and find out when the ieee meeting is tonight still have to write for more minutes took me long time to get on to the psy homepage wonder why because all the other internet sites go to always show up real fast guess kristine is not going to go with me to sign up for psychology experiments by the way thing that these experiments that we have to do are bs think that that the psychology department needs someone to experiment on so they make the psy students be the guinea pigs think spelled that wrong oh well if we do not do the experiments they punish the students by making them write to page paper ultimatum really need to work on my spelling but will not oh yea also have to pay the owe ut ill do that by tex after finish this essay still have minute left really hate writing papers glad that got out of english everybody says that need to get into study groups if want to survive engineering need to get into some study groups guess by the way didnt mean to caps the need in the last sentence oh well is so guess about done now lalalalalalalalala
entering big campus with so many different people how interesting this will be kind of new experience meeting other students just as smart or even smarter can bring ideas to this school and to others as well as the school and students to me hopefully do well or excel beyond my potential where can feel proud and to just prove my abilities to myself things now are little different where live what eat who meet but seems that everybody has to deal with the same things or hurdles in that everybody are fighting scratching or just competing to be the best or is everybody just content to making to college due to their being content the race for those competing will be easier for them but are we in rat race to achieve greatness there are also other things in life other thatn to prove that one person is somehow better academically because of test made by some professor and to the subjects covered by what the professor says theres to find leisure time when not having to study school can be easily sluffed off but students are paying for classes in which makes person certified to do job in which that person studied money do not grow on trees people gots to earn to feel good about oneself but is also the little things that can person feel good like just getting together with friends and talking to eat something thats very tasteful to just observe how folks interact with certain situations and how watching or observing these things can help me without me having to go through but somethimes some things have to experienced by oneself to fully understand things arent what they always seem just by loooking college has too much to offer where everything arent feasible to understand and just let things be
almost done with my pre-testing survey think of done would have finished but got kicked off will try again later excited right now about tonight because going to see shania twain in concert starting to listen to country now and really like like because the songs actually are saying something and not just rambling on most of the songs deal with love and life which find very interesting this weekend might go home that is why wanted to finish the pre-testing and the writing assignments either today or tomorrow so that can go home if decided to mixed feelings about going home want to go home because on of my friends step-father has cancer and is not doing well at all the doctors didnt give him much time his family is having benefit bar-b-que to raise money to help pay his medical bills not that close to my friends family and somewhat close to my friend so do not know if should go home and help out or not my services were not asked for however think would be kind gesture to go down and help because extra help is always useful during things like this also would appreciate friends help if was in situation like this also my cousin and his fiancé are having their engagement party on saturday evening do not really want to go because those things are usually boring but standing up in the wedding so thought would be nice to go if cannot make they will understand in fact do not think would even be missed that much but you never know do not want to go home because just went home two weekends ago kind of confused as to whether or not will go but tonight to decide right now kind of feeling good about myself because just got the results back from test took wednesday in my medical and science terminology class got the highest grade you could get was so did pretty good also my sister who is two years older than and are taking the same class and we were kind of competing to see who gets better grade the night before she thought she had all down and was confident that she would do better than however she ended up getting on the test so feel good about myself because in way proved myself to her now though to continue to do well so that at the end of the semester can have good grade and even maybe will be better than hers earlier my sister and went to lunch and we had small argument is nothing too unusually for us to argue but just feel bad think could have been more considerate of her feelings we argued because she wanted me to walk with her from jester to guadalupe st would have gone normally but was raining outside and did not want to get wet guess that was mean of me not to join her so told her to wait for me and she kept going so just stayed at jester feel bad now because should have gone with her but oh well will just have to call her later and apologize hopefully she will forgive me right now also worried because do not know if completed this assignment correctly not sure because do not know if this was what you wanted me to write well hope did
been in the mood to do any homework find very hard just to sit down and study as freshmen found many new experiences in the past week finally getting my email hooked up received my mail that has been sitting in my inbox for about week my good friend from home wrote me from south west she informed me of great news she is having ball at her new school she is on the drill team and making many new friends which leads me to about one oclock yesterdaysunday as came home from church was excited to see that had two messages all for me the first one is from friend who attends ut the other was from my best friend who sadly is going to another college in wacol we could only talk for about fifteen minutes which was not enough time however was long enough so could hear all about the great time she is having with all of her new friends which leads me to the point that feeling terribly lonely do not mean to sound jealous of my friends good fortunes but envious see came to ut because didnt want to go to am because my brother went there ut and am were the only two schools which applied truthfully not too excited about coming here however do not want to go to am is so secluded and good two hours farther from home anyway so moved up here and moved into an apartment because my mom thinks dorms are too loud so roommate who is twenty and she does her own stuff and is hardly home always here all by myself total of four friends up here one of which heather spent all of my senior year bickering with because she never seemed to respect my religious views she knows how to get under my skin however we are closer than any of my other friends up here which leads to the final three lindsey goes to st edwards and is so homesick she misses her boyfriend and her mother which is understandable katie is nice and wonderful but we havent spent too much time together and sandra sandra known since the seventh grade and didnt talk to her much my junior and senior years you see her and lindsey are best friends and they got in fight their junior year and stopped talking so me being the insincere person which takes lindseys side my reasoning was because thought sandra was inconsiderate of others needs you see had every single class with her our sophomore year and we kind of got tired of each other so back to the present do not really know anybody and bad at meeting people because do not know what to say do not think quite or shy because thats far from but just do not know how to go up to people and strike up conversation which leaves me very lonely is mainly my fault because do not want to spend much time with heather because we just know the right way to almost kill each other katie who is great and there really is not good excuse except do not really feel connectedis that stupid lindsey who is so homesick that she doesnt want to do anything and sandra who called me yesterday just to talk now how nice is that mean went to sandras today before class and had fun shes nice not to mention beautiful skinny and very smartvery which guess why used to have bad feelings towards her shes invited me to do stuff with her and her new friendswhich she made but kind of want to meet my own friends group of new friends also lindsey the homesick one made friends too which is good because she needs to be happy however think is about time for me to make some friends well also tried out for the ballet class here sucks so mad there are two classes freshmen class and an intermediate was stuck in the freshmen class is so bad taken ballet for fifteen years and have been en pointe for eight not to mention there is no pointe here not trying to sound smug because was far from being the best at my studio at home but these girls are beginners and some of the stuff we are doing is so elementary do not get me wrong was going to use this to my own benefit and work on techinque but when the teacher stopped us in the middle of combination to tell us were to place our arm on the barre almost died know where to put do not need help with that need help with my turnout extension balance not with were to put my arm on the barre well as you can see not excactly happy camper glad wrote this was fun my fingers feel like they are going to fall off but sure need to get used to that well going home this weekend to go see ballet my company puts on is peter and the wolf weve done before is going to be cute was the duck my friend sarahwho goes to south west was the bird she was great dancer she was strong and very precise she danced the lead in the nutcrackernot clara but the dew drop she shared with elizabeth who dance the cat elizabeth is beautiful dancer she has such grace she was going to go to oklahoma on scholarship but she ruptured her disc and cannot dance for year so she stayed home my other good friend is ginny shes sophomore she is very good because she was dancing with all of us who are two years older so those are all of my wonderful friends in ballet love ballet we also have this one dancer named vanessa she has extension to die for that means her leg goes all the way to her ear she is great love ballet that makes me so happy well thanks for this assignment ill see you in class but doubt youll see me ill probably drop by you office sometime hope this makes since
really not sure what to write because just am not feeling anything right mow but feeling good because listening to good music and that is something that will always make me feel good and do not know why but even if really down music picks up and makes me feel better and especially like to go to see live shows that is just about the only thing really love to go out and do usually would rather just sit at home and watch tv or listen to music also feeling hungry and my roommate is making some vegetarian chili which kind of scares me because not really into vegetarian meals but hey might as well eat if he is going to make also wondering how long been writing because seems like long time but think has only been like ten minutes or so and running out of things to say guess could talk about this girl seeing she is really cool but do not really think want to get involved with her in the way she wants to get involved with me but guess should go out on another date before come to that conclusion that has been something that has been bothering me because she apparently likes me lot but just do not think like her in that way that she likes me and guess that now out on my own this is the first real problem had was dating and to tell you the truth scares the hell out of me because when comes to sex you never know what kind of diseases girl might have and that scares me lot

start this essay feeling little wary because doing little late starting to think about what to write think that if do not write something intellingent will come off as dumb or ignorant as to what feeling also thinking erotic thoughts also feeling embarassed for writing that down scared that after reading this you will think that pervert which not once again thinking about what to write once again thinking that if do not write something smart will come off as dumb beginning to think of friends from back home people left behind family friends teachers with whom had pretty good relationships now thinking of conversation had with two other friends on very private issue my father comes into my head also times spent with him after he and my mother seperated then think of times with my stepmother and how my mother would dislike if she knew that acknowledge her as someone related to me now feeling little anxious because do not want my sister to come home right now and see that wrote something about having erotic thoughts now am thinking of girl in one of my classes is not erotic just thinking of what she looks like in the class and how would like to talk to her sometime then start to feel little down because ivent made any really close friends in college yet just aquaintences again thinking about what to write just got an image of the capitol as looks from the tower and just thought about the tower think about going to mezes hall to sign up for an experiment now worrying again because ivent signed up for one
well suppose one of the first things that enter into my mind are why in the world did wait this long to get assignments like this done always put lot of unneccesary pressure on myself by putting these things off ivent been doing in college so far but know if was more productive with my time id be better off that and money ivent been very good with money lately oh plenty to live on but spend lot of money on things simply do not need also tend to spend money unwisely like buying things somewhere when know can get them somewhere else much cheaper but buy anyways because is there and convenient do not have any income right now eithher need work-study job but that shouldnt be too hard already paid my rent for the semester and so job should cover my phone bill and other little living expenses just fine got some more money coming in for doing webpages for other people too the unfortunate thing is is getting to point where is almost home-run business and beginning to worry about whethter or not taxes become an issue hate filling out forms much less loads of tax forms only and is thing do on the side to make extra money and do not know if should be concerned with such thing as business tax forms and accounting only done three small commerical webpages do not know if that excuses me from anything need to talk to some expert about that money is no object to me in the end though thats probably why so careless about most of been keeping pretty tight track of though just to make sure do not go broke looking at buying computer and think just enough my work study job then could easily cover my little living expenses also spend good bit on music which is something really into not music in general mind you but just the stuff listen too lot of is fairly obscure not even talking about rock obscure or grunge obscure or world music obscure listen to good bit of forgotten artists stuff like albums they release after theyve had their heydey - which is usually in the listen to music basically all the time my roommate has actually been pretty cool about me playing the music all the time sometimes wonder if he minds but do not think he does we have guitar in our room and is my roommates he doesnt play too often only bit now and then hes decent do not know anything though not muscially inclined personally in any way do not sing or play any insturments though wish did something like keyboards or drums would be cool but been learning to apprecaite the guitar more like to hear guitarists who make them sing and make distinct sounds than the heavy clunky stuff most grunge-rock-alternative bands make steve hackett when he was guitarist for genesis way back when is great example heard somewhere that he would try to make the guitar sound more synthesized and as result he played some interesting solos he made the band sound little more floyd-ish guess still thats the kind of guitar id like to learn to play acoustic riffs would be neat to learn too the keyboards would be tough but id think the most fun to play could be the drums drummers have lot of different styles noticed wouldnt leanr to play really fast and make lot of noise would want to learn how to play perfectly timed melodic noises - stuff that doesnt take just speed but lots of skill too do not know how most bands play now days but drums do not always particularly stand out in some songs now days but guess lot of them do not hold that as important when phil collins was drummer for genesis the drums had moments in the songs when they really stood out not because they were loud neccessarily but because they were different with what you usually heard they didnt go along with the song they would almost lead the song really though all of the members of the band genesis make such great band which if you havent caught on by now is my favorite band getting little tired and lot more reading and some homework to do tomorrow is monday and classes start up again fun

ok so do not understand how people can get into relationships that are so suffocating my friend was just telling me how his girlfriend was mad at just because he didnt call her right at am he also told me that he couldnt tell his girlfriend that he was out with me at heb because then that would make her jealous what kind of relationship is that when there is no trust even though they say they love each other blah blah blah theyve been going out for less than months and they are talking about love and marriage cannot imagine falling in love so quickly maybe that is because never been in that situation before my friends always ask why do not date been trying to figure out that myself usually use the copout answer that do not have the time which is indeed true also think that do not date because ivent found the person who click with there are some friends feel totally comfortable around but they are too good of friends and that would be way too awkward supposedly as others say could get any guy want but totally doubt that guess just have low selfesteem but do not know thats kind of an extreme statement to make think also been so independent all my life because of mommy and daddy always being at the restaurant that basically raised myself there could have been so many opportunities for me to turn bad but didnt yet things my parents never think anything is good enough feel like they always see the bad in me if do something good they praise that but automatically follow with negative quality about me how do you think that makes me feel whats the point of trying if nothing if ever good enough always do things to please others doing pharmacy because my parents want me to and do not want to disappoint them because see how hard they work and what they have gone through with my brother sometimes get so depressed when realize that they are putting all their hopes on me and they make me feel guilty when do not do what they want me to do sometimes feel is too much pressure on me and just want to cry and give up everything do not they understand that that is too much pressure for me and that might crack one day and go crazy sometimes always ask why me and why my family like why are we going through these tough financial situations when we are such good people but then realize how lucky we are we have home food and all the people in my immediate family are healthy and living hear horror stories of what other people have to suffer through and make point to not take anything for granted because everything could completely change in blink of an eye also ask why are all the girls so much prettier than me and why not as smart as others then hear kids that are born with mental retardation and makes me realize how lucky to be healthy and normal so hard sometimes to see of all the good things you have when you envy what others have thats serious problem should just be content with what and not worry about what others have like to be nice to others but when see my friends giving more attention and things to my other friend who is always mean and whiney whats the use of being nice and submissive why do all the good guys lose guess that is just how the world works and that is so pathetic guess that is how human nature is went to the ut dance clinic tonight and wish was good enough to make just do not pick up combinations up as quickly as the other girls wish could because really want to make love to dance wish could do that for the rest of my life but not good enough to make my profession is so relaxing and truly love doing do not think pharmacy is what want to do for the rest of my life seems to boring but absolutely no idea what want to do guess ivent found my niche in the world wish just knew what wanted to do and go with why do change my mind so often life would be so much easier if could just figure out what exactly wanted to do with my life just hope my future is all hope to be happy prosperous healthy and with someone truly love

just ate brisket rice and kimchi is very odd mixture but was really good can still smell the barbecue sause and taste the sause on the corners of my mouth cannot believe how much things want to accomplish this semester and everything seems to go slow is difficult making friends because not used to ssing so many students in one class and everything time ifferent group of people sit with feel lonely and little bit frustrated sense not really sure what would make me feel alittle better is friday and seems like is the weekend is bit odd because not in school or in class few minutes ago came back from barnes and nobles and attempted to study biology chemistry and alittle bit for this class but only managed to study for biology mitosis what an interesting process is still boring because know all this material from high school get so bored of learning the old material over and over again however this chapter did continue on with the enzymes and other chemical components needed so tired right now had very nice sleep maybe little over eight hours but so tired kind of dozed off at bn and stopped reading instead picked up harry potter book ivent been able to read and started to read think wasted more time reading that book than reading one chapter in biology got into that book quite quickly and was not able to put down started to have headache and got hungry do not have headache anymore gee is only seven minutes and about thirteen minutes left how come everytime stop counting or timing end at the number thirteen thirteen hours of classes thirteen minutes left thirteen this and thirteen that my goodness must have tons of bad luck or is this my lucky number haha that would be very interesting feel quite happy right now still remember the events that occured last night can still here the the drums vibrating off the speakers and the guitars and the singers that can barely hear frequency was pretty nice for the first one went to was so humid and felt so sticky gross do not know what thinking right now my train of thought seems to be discombobulated always go to one subject to the next seems that everyone does that but is weird even when talk to many people digress off the subject can not believe typing for twenty minutes done this before but had to hand write out the good thing about hand writing is that takes longer time and you do not have to constantly think or what you are thinking next my eyes are feeling alittle droopy now should close my eyes and type haha okay will do that might start falling asleep if do this maybe should open my eyes again okay well wonder if grammar and punctuation and capitalization really matters in this writing assignment what coincidence is been thirteen minutes again why do do this to myself my hands are feeling little numb from typing this but my palms havent become sweating but my fingers feel weird maybe is because of the rubber band aroiund my wrist is must be cutting off circulation thinking right now that will not be able to quit just heard my brothers alarm on his watch my brother is still in highschool wonder how much torture hes going through hated us history in highschool and now my brother is taking it is not that hated the content didnt like the teacher she was so evil the clock rang that is three-oclock my aim had shut the door telling me that someone went offline wow still going on three more minutes left my neck is hurtingn and want to quit think this assignment is so long want to take break but do not think will be able to think typing faster than was in the beginning want this writing assignment to be over now now now now now now now just babbling out looking at the xperiment record sheet for psychology wow five hours yes one more minute left to do this should count down want this to be over now wish was over not why almost thirty more seconds so impatient now very impatient very very impatient almost done ten more five seconds look like is over
just read the asterix at the bottom of the screen about your social security number and sounded like the most rediculous thing ever mean obviously you do not want you ssn to be taken but if youre telling carla you have to speak quietly so no one overhears you what the hell read out loud to my roommate and good friend from high school margaret and she said was probably serious because our freshman english teacher in high school got her social security number stolen was sick this morning and skipped all my classes do not know if should write that because now maybe you think slacker but really felt like complete shit did go out last night til like but really snotty and coughing up phlegm so last night when got home had to walk home early because margaret felt like way faint and was supertired and her face was white-it was weird so we came back and was little drunk and called my ex from high school but hes still my best friend and we talk all the time jacob was so funny he answered the phone- was really surprised because he sleeps like log but he answered and sounded kind of awake so asked him if woke him up and he said no he was about to take nap though but sure he was woken up really like him and think ill probably end up with him someday just because cannot picture ever having friend can confide in as much as him and feel like he knows me inside and out-however cheesy that may seem but still get elated when he calls me and love talking to him most of the time really excited because tonite going to ka pledge line with one of my friends from high school daniel ka pledge cannot decide if should wear this black tube dress with white ribbon on or this black mock turtleneck dress thats little bit longer and supertight is very flattering but seems like guys always like strapless stuff and to wear my superhigh heeled shoes with the mock turtleneck dress and lot of guys like petite girls might go with that one anyway though because like zit on my chest and shows with the tube one but met jeb bush few times and way starstruck with him and want to go on date with him really bad just so can say could kind of and hes kind of short but crush on this pothead of course always attracted to that type except jacob whos tall and his name is clayton may just forget about jeb and go for the tall shoes haha so only been writing for minutes seconds so much time left and already feel like the most shallow girl ever- not to mention slacker for skipping class already chandler my suite mate and are going to go to the ssb later and then-shopping you can never be too sick to shop so right now undeclared liberal arts and was thinking about transferring to the business school and then was like what the hell am doing because hate math and economics so dropped economics and added art history which do like and decided to just stick with calculus-unfortunately got on my calculus homework yesterday great already that sucks ass but taking textiles-which sounds like another crap course but really interested in fashion merchandising as major want to be buyer when grow up or own cute little clothes store think that would be blast but told my dad was taking textiles and he laughed his ass off for like minutes and mentioned fashion merchandising but not like was going to do and he would absolutely die and disown me if majored in that he was like you can still major in english and be buyer but know hes going to tell the whole family taking textiles and theyre all going to laugh at me and think dumb but whatever textiles really is harder than some of my other classes like french that you would think would be really hard class we have to memorize like different kinds of fabrics and their properties yikes so like aching right now and really think west nile chandlers brothers friend in baton rouge had to have his appendix out because they thought was appendicitis but he really had west nile how much does that suck so like ut ok right now but from what heard everyone saying about the college experience being the best thing ever do not know so much right now cannot imagine ever having friends as close as the ones had in high school or meeting people as nice as the ones in baton rouge louisiana people seem way nicer to me than texas people
here on friday september something ever since started college had hard time keeping up with the date not really smart thing to do since to stay on top of things here need to start keeping daily planner say that everyday but then forget to do and is just one of those things that end up on my mental list of things to do pretty hungry right now no take that back not that hungry could eat but is not to the point where feel like to eat my friend and are going to lunch today so glad that made friend that can hang out with and talk to all the time is not the same like my friends at home though miss melissa and amber really do not know why is that we now talk multiple times to each other everyday but back home we would go days without speaking we talk about nsync lot more now too typical we find comfort in them in our time of need wonder if the nsync guys would think that were crazy if they knew that we talked about them everyday and that we have daily arguments about who justin belongs to and who jc belongs to they crack me up heck crack myself up we talk on the phone and melissa and amber rolling on the floor with laughter is so awesome to make other peole laugh when usually the one doing the laughter lot of times just laugh to be polite fake pretty well if do say so myself wonder if this assignment has to be broken up into paragraphs well if this is just my one continuous thought then guess not okay love my dorm and where we live but for goodness sakes could somebody please turn up the air conditioning think the university is trying to freeze us into studying hope they know that theyre just freezing me into complaining all the time and another thing is impossible for people to not slam their doors really doesnt take that much effort to quietly close the door should randomly slam my door think every hour on the hour going to slam my door no thats not frequent enough ill slam the door every twenty minutes and see if they all get the point really though dorm life is not bad at all my dorm room is so cute and really like my roommate no waiting to use bathroom or shower stalls and we have an awesome living room setting still do not like to call this place home home is where mom and wayne are this is where reside would take lot for me to consider this place home need to do my biology homework wonder if all those scientists know how completely boring their jobs are the funny thing is that at least they have something to do with their lives cannot even decide what my favorite color is let alone what the crap going to do with the rest of my life pretty sure that life as professional bum is out of the question do not think mom would be proud of me then okay looks like my time is running out and should finish this on my own rather than be cut off mid sentence okay how do end this really do not know this was actually kind of fun just another way for me to analyze my random boring and crazy thoughts red hot chili peppers on vh now got to go and were out in bye says that can finish writing but honestly got date with fine young man named biology
feeling little worried right now about my classes and how well ill do on the tests and other assignments used to the class settings now but is still little strange to me to be in class with or more students wonder how ill do in my biology and chemistry classes next semester because already heard how difficult is stressed out with college work due to the daily reading assignments and to take notes over the material for my future exams wish was senior so can get out of this place and not have to study ever again miss home and wish could go visit sometime soon but of course cannot because tests and other things coming up cannot wait until thanksgiving so can go home and relax with my family and friends wish knew more people here or at least have some close friends ivent been able to start conversation with anyone in my class is probably because shy and afraid to go up to stranger and just casually start conversation really do miss my high school friends and just wish was back in high school was so much easier and more fun oh well everyone said college is going to be the most fun and memorable part of your life after attending the tuesday night bible study felt really happy and greatful that got to meet such nice and open-hearted people the praise was great and liked the prayer time too ivent prayed to god recently and gave me the opportunity to communicate with him again but felt guilty because do not pray to god like everyone else on regular basis seems as though only pray to god when need help or feeling worried and sad should continually pray to him from now on because is important that establish an existing relationship with him glad tomorrow is friday yay only have section tomorrow and then free until monday hopefully ill have fun weekend unlike last week when just stayed in my dorm and study

how necessary is sleep the past few days been going to morning swim practice and then my classes is only four to five hours enough know that there are plenty of other students that are also recieving either this amount or even less but is the amount of sleep affecting them to certain degree or can person simply get use to right now feeling somewhat tired but know that enough homework to get done to stay awake and complete will all of this suddenly crash down on me or will get use to this kind of sleep cycle also wonder if organized enough to do well in most of my classes not just to barely are my notes as good as they should be or should be taking more during class write down most of the important or interesting points that the professor comments on but do need more details in order to do well the past few days recieved two different parking tickets that thought were unnecessary double checked all of the signs in the area and even asked the front desk of my dorm concerning that location the signs indicated that was not parked illegally and the front desk said that was perfectly alright to park there if could find spot but after two different parking tickets from the exact same spot guess now have to pick different location wonder though if the tickets will be able to be dismissed because of the lack of indication for this site wrote couple of e-mails to try and appeal both tickets but have recieved no word back the front desk said that the people in that department would only drop one of the tickets if either this is mainly because of the lack of evidence that which think is incredibly stupid
not sure where to start at thinking of course used to thinking and all guess really sleep right now always sleepy oh and so used to not doing the correct english thing like with caps and punctuation and all hope that doesnt take off from grading oh well when first signed in my native instinct was to sign onto aim always do that love talking to my friends miss them so much sure ill find some here that are great and will never want to let them go but for now the computer chat thing will do oh so excited because one of my good friends that met probably one month before came here is suppose to visit right before thanksgiving holiday hell probably stay here for two nights then come back to longview with me and my sister hopefully really excited about tonight me and two of my friends from high school are going to the concert thing at cannot wait cannot wait there are so many things need to do like set up an online account for my bank check status on my sisters book that to buy for her do the pretesting for psy class wonder what that is about almost hesitant to sign up for experiments but know will be good for me haha when told my friend his name is bryant that had to do this writing assignment he told me that was going to be just his name over and over again good thing is not one of my favorite things to do in longview is to go to book-a-million say do not like to some people but really do because surrounded by books theres so many of them love looking at pictures the way the earth comes together as whole and works so well amazes me is so quiet around here theres just the sound of typing and think someone is moving back in forth in his/her chair because there is an occassional thud oh well hope other assignments are as interesting as this one good thing can delete my mess ups because making tons of them so used to having the computer fix the caps or the right punctuations yeah the teachers probably shouldnt tell kids that are learning in school that the computer does that or theyll become lazy like half of students wish knew some great jokes to tell add some spice into this uh assignment well my sister did tell me one the other day but cannot remember some of hope everything is okay with judy know must be hard living in laredo with so much of nothing to do haha she called last night when me and christina were watching van wilder such great movie and she wouldnt shut up so me and christina would joke around that she was being like mom that was good love being able to joke with my sisters theyre so much fun well two of them anyway keep looking at the finish button and read over and over again so is difficult to think when read finish constantly my wrist are hurting stupid edge of the table they should really see about fixing that sure could cause some kind of danger to computer uses in the far future woops just kicked something hope was not important what to think not sure look around and see scanner white plain wall many letters and numbers some monitors sunpicture of sun that is pen doesnt really smell much like anything around here so whats going on with the clear mouse do not understand mean do but whats the point is like high quality ghetto mouse pretty much only has one clicker uh button speaking of button was suppose to do something with autumn oh yeah she said no because was with someone she doesnt get along with oh well her loss wonder what the people in lview are doing right nowblue think that is one of my favorite colors of course is always been
ok here go wonder what most people are thinking of when they are writing this probably all kinds of things well girlfriend her name is lauren and today is our month aniversary excited but sad that do not get to see her that much because she is still in high school she goes to clark in san antonio just like did thats where we met we were both on the cross country team kind of tired wish didnt have to spend all my time reading the iliad is getting really boring and do not even think is very good book they just like because is old like last night spent several hours reading and still had to do more before went to class today man is only been minutes do not think can actually think for whole wonder what would be doing if was not doing this right now probably doing calculus homework or reading heaven-for-bid the iliad cannot wait until the weekend when can relax some more at least only have one class tomorrow and is really easy is calculus and this is my third year in row of taking for shouldnt have any trouble with unfortunately though is all stuff already learned so is boring also lets see that makes two boring classes now how about ancient rome and ba those are also boring classes but at least like rome so at times that class can be interesting so that leaves psychology thats definitely the best class taking because is really interesting especially because many of the things do not have answers so is just what you think probably biased towards though because always been math and science fan math was ruined by one teacher had but still love science hopefully can use the business skills learn to start or work for something like bioengineering company that would be cool psychology is also fun because know few people in there one of the guys in there went to pre-school and kindergarten with and havent really seen him since monday met this girl named jessica shes pretty nice so someone to talk to before class bjorn just got home wonder where hes been he probably was at class wonder which one he really likes cake and he just turned them on can tell when hes in his room usually because there is music on he also likes the beatles do not really like the beatles but cake is cool wonder who just got on aim guess was rory because he just imed me wonder what he wants maybe ill have to tell him to go away but probably will not because not that kind of person do not like putting people down or causing conflict guess thats just who im think thats the best quote ever heard can be interpreted in so many ways and is the only think that we know is absolutely true
work right now guess little hesitant about writing this stream of consciousness because we never do this in school were always asked to write on specific topic or something of that sort and to write what we think is such broad topic sick and do not think is because of those freshman jitters you were talking about was completely confident in going to school nonetheless got sick my parents say is because do not have enough sleep or because the dorms have diseases do not live in the dorm though which is both plus and bad thing like living off campus because feels more homey and seems like theres place to get away from school then again lot of my friends live on campus so do not necessarily get to hang out with them lot is ok though because they always try to include me yesterday studied at pcl until midnight and my friend was so worried about me walking home alone that she made these two guys walk home with us bad congestion and my mind seems like is under lot of pressure so if do not make sense that is probably why listening to music which seems kind of girly and feel that the guy work with might think is too but he hasnt said anything no matter what do like to have music on when sleep when study is habit guess the main thing on my mind is successively passing my classes no doubt that will pass but passing with as is another thing one of those girls who went through all years of basic schooling with all as and have never had problem with being behind in class or even worrying about getting might seem like the work of perfectionist but was not always the most studious quite the procrastinator ever since started college however seems like had quite an interest in my classes and studying of course theres the occasional partying but seems like college is an experience to do what you want to do like to study and learn and feel as if accomplished something on my own will is like reading when was little used to read lot as school started they always made us read books so lost interest in the joy of reading willingly this past summer read uncle toms cabin and was wonderful was probably the first book read on my own for awhile when theres studying to do and organizations to participate in theres no time for leisure time like reading or watching tv that is one thing proud of since gotten here ivent watched much tv wish was more of news-person but the news just doesnt catch my interest all that much is like everyday theres another child missing or new statistic that everyone is obese guess shows like dateline or / that show the in-depth look at stories are more my style we were told story in mythology about how people used to have four legs and four arms and two heads and was like they were connected by their backs well these people became overly arrogant and so the gods decided to split the two in half so there would be more of them and they would be more efficient and they wouldnt gloat so much then they scattered the halves all around the world and that is why we go around searching for our other half like this story so much because romantic hopeless romantic is more the term would use to describe myself even though been wonderfully single for years theres this hope that there will be special someone will have sparks with and this higher connection to do not know if watched too many movies or have too many daydreams but guess like most girls searching for their prince charming sometimes look into the atrological signs of which virgo usually always says that virgos get bored quickly think that in way that way is horrible to say but think ill tire of someone quickly if they do not keep my interest of course like to keep everyone as friends but romantically speaking there has to be something different about person theres song by ashanti that goes want to be like those girls in the movies have guy fall hopelessly in love with me now that seems kind of selfish but to know that guy really cares about you and would sacrifice many things for you is really different characteristic guys nowadays are so un-chivalrous feel like little boy-crazy girl right now but my friend had mentioned that should talk about this in my writing and guess kind of stuck fortunately completely content with my life and feel that lot going for me not at all ashamed of being single but theres always those people who ask why theres no guy in my life what do say to them love being single theres those girls who go blind by love and hope to never lose myself in the process of loving someone else is crazy

really know what to type about hope this does not have to be like grammatically correct or anything because do not ever use capital letters twenty minutes is really long time do not know if can even type that lone do not know if ever have in my entire life without stopping or taking break is weird to write down what thinking because think try to think about what to write so not completely sure this is really what thinking hope no one reads this too carefully so is always been really cold in my room but now is kind of hot think this could be good way to vent some of my feelings keep thinking about kurt and wonder if should call him back or not everyone keeps saying to never call him back because he only called me because rachel is in dallas but do not even think for sure that he called because he wants to get back together maybe he just wanted to explain since he never did think my foot is falling asleep almost wish had desktop computer so that this keyboard was not so small my hand keeps hitting the mouse while type and waves around in front of what writing and that makes hard to concentrate anyways do not want kurt to think that been sitting around hoping that he would call or anything because at first pop up just came up on my screen didnt think they would bother me that much but is starting to get on my nerves esp ok so this other thing just popped up and said to hold down enter for ten seconds to see some cool thing and didnt want to because with all my pop ups figured would just lead to porn or something of the likes so tried to push the little in the corner and wouldnt close and then went to some screen with stars or something and said enjoy your break now get back to work at first thought was for this maybe was but then got back to this screen and my time was starting all over that sucks hope this is over soon anyways still thinking about kurt no one can assume that he called me back because he wants to get back together he could just want to talk he did say the first time that he just called to see how been and still mad at him for what he did but do want to forgive him because just do not want something like that hanging over me forever and hate to hold grudges and do want us to be friends and know would be hard for me to say didnt want him back but even if that is what he wanted wouldnt do no matter how hard because of what he did to me plus in college and do not need to have boyfriend back home need to meet people but really do miss him lot hope gets easier which is part of why will call him because really need to close that part of my life and end and cannot think of the word but something like finalize hope my battery does not die on my laptop and hope that another popup does not come and mess up my time again because really need to get this done lot to do today but glad got done what did this morning need to find out about the whole football ticket draw thing and hope wrote down in my planner about that trig review class then

sitting in front of my computer in small jester dormitory look around and notice that the room is complete mess take deep breath and can smell something funny thats right thats how jester rooms always smell like feeling pretty full right now after eating delicious sandwich from the jester city limit is the room is nice and cold unlike the hot and humid weather outside my roommate is out of the room right now so is little quieter than usually playing some music on my computer right now besides the music coming out of the speakers of my computer can hear occasional chatter and doors opening and closing in the hallways my roommate walks in after eating at jester city limit is say hi to him and how his dinner was he notices something weird as read out what typing he asks what the crap are you doing respond by telling him that this is for my psychology class turn my attention away and try to think of what to write next sitting upright in an uncomfortable wooden chair that came furnished with the room uncross my legs because my left leg is starting to feel numb hear someone using the blow-dryer in the bathroom which is right outside of my room look up at my bookshelf and see all my textbooks that reminds me that lots of other homework to do when finish with this assignment strange anxious feeling because little behind in all my classes especially with reading the textbooks think about how missed three morning classes already quiz in one of those classes and get an awful guilt-like feeling because do not want to do badly in my classes maybe should go to sleep earlier tonight for that matter every night notice my computers processor making slight noises as typing take off my glasses because only need them to read look back up at the bookshelf and remind myself how much work still have left to do notice that been shaking my right leg maybe been doing this the whole time some sort of nervous habit guess feel little pain on the surface of my knee reach down and touch the band-aid covering wound that suffered from playing soccer at clarkfield last night and the twenty minutes is up pop up says that can keep on writing with my stream of consciousness does that mean that should just finish with my train of thought or should keep writing more and more maybe that would help me get better grade on this assignment ok going to just stop and press the finish button
clear waters beckening - wow - this is not going to work - my mind is blank - or is - is just blank because to write down what is going threw hmmmm is degrees celcius right now that does not even really matter prob will not go outside unless need to smoke cigarette or something spike tv what kinda dumb sh is this this show sucks - why are they trying to advertise this show with some crazy exciting name like spike tv - minutes is long time to be typing wonder if matters how crude my thoughts are better keep tha inappropriate thoughts out is that possible yeah school takes up lot of time - and do not know if getting degree will even matter so what is the point should just stop typing right now pack bag get in my car and drive to mexico wonder what the point of that survey earlier was where do all these personal type surveys going is some little guy sitting behind desk compiling information about me based on the questions filled out about once year since was old enough to go to publicly funded schools if there really is guy that is comparing all my information right now - wonder how much someone in that position would get paid hahah - getting paid to make assumptions about person out of bunch of personal questions think that job would be pretty boring would have to get intoxicated or something before going to work everyday that tedious paper work would drive me crazy that is prob why people go all postal and shoot people at work - cause they have to do tedious crap everyday that has no bearing hope nothing pushes me over the edge of insanity that would suck might not be bad though - imagine the government would provide pretty comfortable living for someone who was mentally handicapped bet few people have thought they were insane and really been on the same wave as everybody else is crazy to be alive and conscious consciousness gets dull - nothing modern intoxicannots cannot handle though in moderation joe millionarie was gay show resent that guy think going to go smoke cigarette cannot really think of what to say need cigarette to calm me down that is not even how you spell cigarette but spelling is not even that important mean - is like this - professors and anyone else in my life has ragged on me about spelling and grammar but they know - and know - that they knew what the meaning of the word misspelled that kinda shit pisses me off need smoke
amazing how much free time you have in college totally different experience from when was in my grade school years grade school seems like was in the th grade is hard to believe that my high school years were actually my grade school years as well and now in place of people where youre lucky if people know who you are but with all this free time is hard to fill with stuff to do all the time naps are great way of filling up lots of hours but you can only sleep so much remember laying in bed last night and having feeling of homesickness even though only live minutes away and can go home with the push of seven digit is feel bad for the people who are from small towns million miles away not only are they far from home but being thrown into the fire that is ut and surviving is difficult task for anyone let alone coming from towns / the size of ut but been enjoying my college experience so far being able to sleep late wake up late take hour naps all of not having to sit in classroom for an hour and half every other day is major plus as well come to think of no idea how sat through those days and actually was focused for is entirety the xbox is calling my name as write taunting me with glimpses of football and shooting is amazing how people think that video games are responsible for their child being violent and whatnot parents are blaming series of circuit is and programs as the reason their kid is messed up if people were being better parents these kids would have better things to do than rot their brains in front of tv screen in todays world of money money and more money is hard to find time to put aside what is quite important in the world and spending time with the people that matter most not that tvs bad heck watch way too much of myself but my parents also ingrained in me the difference between right and wrong and was lucky enough to be born right before the start of the technological age so get the best of what the world has to offered right now but had my values and beliefs ingrained in me before this ever-growingly corrupt world took over growingly is that word is hard to write for twenty minutes straight without going off on tangent and starting to focus on other things like the schlotskys cup sitting in front of my desk thats been sitting there for few days and is probably starting to be safe haven for mold speaking of which there is also box of fajita toppings that have been sitting in our refrigerator since school started and yet even though remember still do not get off my butt and throw out keep telling myself that ill do when actually take out the trash but heck we only take the trash out like once week remember doing stream of consciousness writing as one of my creative works in high school for book we read because thought that stream of consciousness writings would be really simple heck you just write whatever comes to your head not too hard right but man think grown up in very rigidly structured school system and always have to plan stuff out before actually start writing so found myself doing more thinking than writing trying to find the right words and grammar usages so that my paper wouldnt sound like first grader wrote but sometimes thats what stream of consciousness writing has to be doesnt matter if you use fifty letter words or big because these writings arent about the content theyre about collecting your thoughts and putting them down no matter how random they be found funny how when you gave out this assignment and asked if there were any questions hands shot up in the air questions arose like how many paragraphs how many words whats the structure we grow up in world of rules where everything is set out before us and we either follow or be considered problem child we spend more time defining the box rather than thinking outside heck we rarely even spend time thinking inside of my dads friend is starting this school in which they let kids pretty much do whatever they want they provide guidance but not rules set boundaries but do not fence the kids in their objective is to let the kid develop his or her own self-discipline not letting some adult develop for him or her so that when they get out into the real world they do not curl up into little ball and hide or rebel and go crazy and not know what theyre doing while think is pretty cool idea others reject the fact that school like this exists because people are ingrained with rules their lives governed by the boundaries of the box so hopefully someday people will be able to think for themselves that we will not become robots that only exist because god told us we could exist at the time that we do exist

assignment is interesting do not think ever attempted to write for minutes straight wonder if adhd or add or if is just because drummer wow only gone for minute and already bored um was watching the cowboy game and they won - vinyl did well but threw an interception think he will be good this year as lond as he doesnt get hurt he has good delivery and is really good at reading defenses speaking of defenses doubt this has any relation but anyways didnt make the hockey team today and was really disappointing really wanted to make and thought that had decent chance maybe gave myself too much credit maybe not big enough or something wish could have made but suppose that one was up to the coach and god speaking of god random again went to really neat church last sunday is name is glad tidings is an assembly of god church although lutheran think might be good match because has really awesome worship and the pastor gives interesting sermons miss my old church though my youth minister back home is getting ordained this weekend unsure if should go home this weekend do not know think will stay here because really want to force myself to become independent even though that would entail me doing the laundry this weekend really tired tonight but suppose will do my best to continue typing the entire minutes but along the thought of the laundry business tried to hold off on doing until next weekend was going to do this weekend but think can make until then has been really hot lately was brutal last saturday trying to run in the morning was so humid eventually rained but not until after the practice never been so sore in my life still sore but guess doesnt matter seeing as not going to be playing for the team suppose is sort of waste but maybe will try and keep in shape do not know though we will see well half-way there still tired and finding this assignment very boring and suppose that would imply that my thoughts are boring kind of sad suppose wish werent so lonely tonight just me and the tv horrible invention is ruins relationships and limit is time for many individuals but suppose helps many escape like to escape by playing video games think might play one in few minutes when get done with this thing but yaw really like my playstation and probably spend too much time on but is really fun and entertaining still tired still tired but only about minutes to go hurray this makes me excited didnt have an antecedent before the this nor did there but that was because quoted the previous mistake wonder who just walked by my room sounded like two girls wonder if there really is girl out there for me probably hope so one can only hope cannot one is funny accidentally made typo and said cannot none which if one thought about logically would produce the same effect but if one thought about from texas perspective would have the opposite negative and depressing effect hope for the logical heard papa johns commercial wonder how they can claim they have better ingredients or better pizza is subjective would think there is another weather report on tv find interesting that people watch weather reports as if they could do anything to alter them usually just go with the flow the flow of the easy river guess is oclock only minute left heres my chance to say something deep really cannot think of anything but live the golden rule and you will find yourself better person love is all you need as paul said the beatle of course lol thats it
