openness to new experiences
psychologists always trying to understand how the mind works and how it does not work in some cases can such things be understood or are we merely deluding ourselves that knowledge of any kind can be attained i guess I have always found psychology to be a very pretentious field though an interesting one we all want to control our lives and anticipating the actions and desires of others helps us maintain that facade of control perhaps I am getting into a more philosophical realm at the moment but that is where my thoughts take me is free will merely an illusion I have thought about this a lot unfortunately there are no definition have answers to this or other questions is there a god I have never heard a logically sound argument for the existence of a god I allow for the possibility of a deity but it certainly wouldnt be the Christian god I think ultimately that I have to agree with the existentialists there is no proof for or against the existence of a god so we should stop wasting time speculating and just deal with this life few people can deal with that our fear of death makes us create religions so that we can pretend there is some resemblance of life after our earthly bodies die these are not new thoughts I am just thinking on demand my mind moves most easily to the pathways it knows and I present some of the more coherent ideas here is someone actually reading this do you understand that I am human I am not an object I am in a body but I am not the body alone I am a mind vast and complex I am do you feel superior because you can analyze minds I ask you this so that you can ask yourself do you enjoy treating people as objects do you even admit in your conscious mind that you treat people as objects perhaps not its possible that I am being slightly unfair to you and your profession still it is good to raise questions we are all just a bit too complacent and easily controlled I see the need for religion but I think many of us are above that I do not need to buy my morality from someone else what moralists and philosophers do I respect Plato for his logic except the theism Kant for his explications of metaphysics and epistemology Nietzsche except at the end of his days lovey except for his dependence on rituals and his arrogance psychologists and behavioral scientists I stay away from most at some point ill get back into it but I was just too turned off by Freud and his pretentious assumptions other reading fiction lots of it I would name a few dozen authors but then why subject myself to the judgments of someone I cant even see music I find music to be very important you cant get by without music and you cant just listen indiscriminately either I think a real understanding of notes rhythms chords and instrumentation is required before one can say anything about any kind of music do you understand music how are you reacting to my questions you must be used to asking the questions instead of having someone else ask them are you getting anything out of this is this more interesting than most responses to the same assignment or do you even care are you turning to a colleague and saying hey this kid was actually making a futile attempt to understand my motives fun with role reversals I considered producing a surreal and rambling narrate have for this assignment but then you might have taken that a bit too seriously bob we got another wacko here ah well time passes and other pursuits await goodbye for now
today I bought the new moodier hatbox cd pure noise and noise art are very interesting forms of music sometimes there are lyrics to these songs most of the time they are just phrases being repeated or just screams some bands have gone so far as to create their own languages this type of music bypasses your brain and hits you straight in the gut words are a very li admitting way of expressing how this music makes you feel I need to remember to go to the video store tomorrow and rent purple rain  prince is very talented as a musician and actor I would love top see hi am in concert I really hope that the October pavement concert will be confirmed soon I cant believe that my English teacher is good friends with the lead singer this is a strange assignment it makes me wonder what other people will write and who will read this will anyone read this? what if someone writes something truly offense have its not their fault one cannot be responsible for their words when they free write can you I imagine if there was an assignment where the teacher tells the students ignore all social constraints and act freely for the next minutes? that would be pretty wild in my everyday speech I often swear by not swearing in this am I li admitting myself but how far can one free write? how much can you open yourself up until its just words thrown together? grammar is not I important to this yet I assume you expect some common grammar to hold this together am I not free writing now? I would like to go on tour with a professional wrestling league and write about their tragic li haves professional wrestlers mutate their bodies with steroids to the point where they no longer seem human they destroy their bodies and on occasion fight in steel cages I wonder if they ever look in the mirror and ask themselves what have I done? I am not even human anymore their job is to fake fight the world of celebrities is quite interesting I wonder if their is an equation that could make someone famous I could use the scientific method my hypothesis could be if one writes a song on the piano Elton john style about celebrity after they die it will be a success  I could have started this when Versace died and continued it when Diana died of course this would not sum it all up but after numerous studies I feel I could lute amately find a mathematical secret to success in the entertainment field 
stream of consciousness well actually i have never done this before but it seems like theres nothing to it i just tell you what i am thinking right? well here is what i am feeling right now i am feeling anticipation because i have a load of laundry going downstairs i really cant wait till its done i guess this feeling of anticipation is only natural since i am doing laundry if i wasnt doing laundry and i still felt like i was waiting for something then that might be a little bit out of the ordinary i am also feeling a tad fatigued considering that i have been up on my feet all day i sense that i could also trace that to the fact that i only got fi have hours of sleep last night i cant stop typing for twenty minutes i cant stop typing for twenty minutes this stream of consciousness stuff is really bizarre it really makes absolutely no sense to me that might be considered a feeling of confusion or bewilderment stemming most likely from my misunderstanding of this assignment from what i write will you guys over there be able to tell what kind of person i am? there you go another sensation one of curiosity that is i wonder why on earth am i doing this i guess there can also be a slight feeling of frustration since i am doing something that i do see the purpose of one thing that i do notice is that there are no margins on this site so if i wanted to i could write and write and write and write and make one really long line in a sense a veritable stream of consciousness that wasnt very clever anyway i was also wondering how many people create a phantom margin like i have been doing what does that tell you or me about me do i like order or do i like being able to see everything that i have written in front of my face well do you know what? its both i like order most of the time i need to keep on typing i need to keep on typing i need to keep on typing another sensation i feel you say? hunger i have not eaten in a while also i only ate one meal today i guess that is a sign of stress i am usually not that stressed out i dont really feel too much stress my sleeping patterns are relati havely normalexcept for last night i really cant figure out what this assignment does is this supposed to help me or you? is this apart of some survey or something? from analyzing all these stream of consciousness documents will you be able to certain things and si amilarities we all share thought patterns and what not? by the way who should i be talking to anyway? i have been using you for a while i feel like i have been talking to you for so long and we havent even met hows it going? my name is walker it is a pleasure to meet you you introductions aside lets get back to this s o c nonsense actually lets not my time is up take it easy 
right now i am very hacked off because it has taken me minutes to find this home page using this very complicated computer i am not used to using macs and it is very annoying i also do not know why this screen does not scroll down that is very annoying also along with this keyboard i am using well i am tired of complaining so i will start thinking about something else i have to leave for my home town in minutes because i have a court date tomorrow my stepdad will be here and i am sure hes going to complain about traffic i hope he takes me to eat somewhere because i am tired of dorm food i cant think of anything to write so ill write that this assignment is very weird and i do not know how anything can come of it what should i say? i do not consciously know what i am thinking so i do not know what to type i am just sitting here trying to think of something profound to say that is stupid considering that i do not have to say anything i amportant but i guess that is what i am used to doing when i write an assignment right now i am staring at a picture of a whales tale as it di haves into the ocean it really looks kind of stupid and i cant think of anything else to say about it you psychology people are strange and i wonder what the heck youre going to do with all these papers that are basically garbage are you going to do some experi ament or what? this is not what i am good at just writing what i think because i usually think about or more subjects at a time and i cant type fast enough to get everything i am thinking onto the page oh well oops i made a grammatical mistake this is very boring and i am tired of typing thank god i only have two more minutes of this hey now its only one minute well its been nice sharing what s in my brain with you and i hope you have fun studying what i have written for hours upon hours i hope it helps in whatever you hope to accomplish see ya 
i do not know what i should be doing right now i mean life is so complicated and strange to me my father says i can do whatever i want to at university and he will be happy with it but the thing is if i do what i want then he would be pretty upset with me hell he would disown me i do not know why i have to do things in order to please hi am but i have to its like i have no choice i am just starting to get his trust back and i do not want to lose that little bit that i have you could say that i am destined to do what other people want me to do that is the way that society is these days we are all conformed to a certain structure in life that we have to follow and if we do not conform then we are outcasts and shunned by society the norm they call it why does there have to be a norm i do not see why we cant li have the way that we choose and be free oh well back to happy thoughts amanda there is a happy thought i wonder i wonder what? i do not know i guess i wonder if it will work i am nuts about he she is nuts about me but we do not get to see each other as much as we would like i guess that is true about a lot of couples but i still do not know what i do know is that i want to stay together even though everyone is talking about us i do not care how old she is hell she is only years younger that me so that does not matter people are just making a big deal out of it because i am in college and she is a sophomore in high school she is still a lot more mature than a lot of people older than me she understands a lot of things i guess that is because she grew up in saudi people there are generally more mature than people here in the states we are forced to grow up faster than people here we lose our innocence faster and have to learn about the world and society as a hole much quicker lets leave it on this note these are strange days that will challenge our true selves i wish i could go deeper than that but i am not going to spill all of my guts to a computer later babe 
ouch that hurts damn damn damn i really do not care much for playing doogie howser as a homework assignment my understanding is that i get to talk about anything i feel like well today i feel like talking about the absence of love i have never and i never will i know this because i know myself i have been acquainted with myself for the past years but you know what? love does not come easily to someone whos never been gi haven the chance to cry over another and disappointment rides high among those who look toward the intangible as an archetype and perhaps love may not be recognized by one who stages the downfalls and disappointments by crowning the archetype and what becomes of these kings? they assure an even greater upset my hell who knew theyd turn out to be human-of all things? theyve been raised by nourishing mothers who want to keep the cycle from breaking down its a revenge thing whats revenge if our elders cant play? and do not think the players of the game do not know they all do in fact theyre the unpolished beads hung through a thin thread patiently awaiting the cut that shatters all they hold the dirty bastards do not mean it on the surface but somewhere inside not too deep they feed off of this perverse pleasure these prowling demons inside sense it they know it and follow it by every word that falls from your mouth they know it by every action pouring out of your senseless heart but wait hold on there is a si ample solution to this problem find that beating cacophony that wakes you in the midst of terror and do the smart thing all women should have accomplished by the age of rip it out spit on it and flush it down that damn toilet praise god for victory no more heartbreaks no more suicidal tendencies so i have heard no more anything anything anything i guess i wouldnt know coming from one whos never been within a foot of love it may seem an i amproper thing to do but for those who have ridden on this vanishing wave i am sure the former action seems more than appropriate however and oh i apologize so profusely for changing the tone so quickly-it loses audience but i do have other things to do um however if this route of throwing the heart is chosen do not forget to wave goodbye to the emotions which allow one to cry laugh or even yes of all things-the sole feeling which gi haves you a natural high for days the sole feeling that allows you to run around the world three times blindfolded on one leg without any replenishing substances-the feeling of love go ahead hypocrite would be a swell characteristic for this girl but must i ask what is it that consumes two people who are in love? the look in their eyes the energy radiating through their bodies? what is it that makes them beautiful? all of the time i have never felt a consistent beautiful for longer than two days consecuti havely my dear patient friend thats exactly how i know it must be this emotion that i have never felt it must be love that emotion not specifically defined by anyone 
i am feeling a little tired right now i usually do not suffer from severe lack of sleep as i have this weekend its pretty interesting the way it affects my ability to concentrate i feel like i do not read as well or communicate ideas as well this is really a weird assignment but i feel like i would be taking the easy way out if i were to sit here and dwell on that for twenty minutes so here goes someone is tapping on a table or something in the next room i hate it when people make a big ruckus doing something like that and then they cant even keep a beat something i think is interesting is the way people can become dependent on new technology in a matter of months when my roommate and i first moved here to austin we didnt have e-mail capabilities at first and i felt completely cut off from the outside world i was so relieved when we were finally back online i just figured out what that tapping was its my roommate playing electric bass but its not plugged in so there is not much pitch distinction like i always say bass should be felt not heard speaking of my roommate everyone has told me that its a bad idea to li have with a friend at college and i think they were right its not that i do not like the guy its just that his annoying traits got magnified tenfold as soon as we moved into a foot by foot room some friends came down from my hometown this weekend their visit made me realize that as soon as i left for college everything changed most of my relationships with people have been faded a little by the move and i am sure its an ongoing process there are a couple of people however that i actually feel closer too and surprisingly theyre not here in austin with me i am still trying to understand that i guess when youre separated from people by large distances you kind of sort things out in your head and figure out who and what is i amportant its like post traumatic prioritizing ok i think i have said what needed or didnt need to be said 
damn rum and coca-cola sure does taste good pretty fucking good in fact hitting return after every line of text that i type really sucks i see danger danger danger on the corner sent by me shadows the ways straight away you ran from me heard you calling yes i heard you calling heard you calling yes i heard you calling no rules why do all the good groups have to stop recording before i get a chance to see them? why does everything piss me off? when i smile people see the devil the devils cool and all but hes still the devil in my dreams i saw you there it was kind of neat because after all i recognized you but it was still a dream about me about you about we never had a chance to get to know each other really well you were always this and i was always that and we were never it became a big problem when you took the easy way out of my mind but as i was saying it was a dream and you were there and so was i and i knew it was a dream but how could it have been a dream when it was so real life experience i started to fly i started to defy gravity pulls us all back down to earth mother earth you angel you rock you bitch you have made everything so wonderfully evil because of you i am here and without you i would surely perish and it is all your fault and scar and torment you place deep inside of my soul wish is to be free yet i am not for i stand here wondering waiting for the time when i can be liberated walk freely as you intended but i saw you there you were and you were dressed differently too not wearing earth clothing of course neither was i red red red honor courage blood blood from me blood from you blood from us from we who i saw there we were wondering waiting for something grand to happen upon us while we stood there the clouds flew overhead like a fast motion video as the world passed us by holding onto my trusty staff i heard the world around me scream shout laugh cry crumble and crumble did i lost my eyes that day i found something different and the world has not been the same since i found them everything has been a little wild a little different a little crazy how things like this end up working out when we see each other and when we went out back into the world from our little sanctuary from the world we were stuck in hurt in side my brain is where this shit all resides and i have a feeling its stuck here because i am still here and youre not 
what about this school too many people running from place to place to be of any noticeable meaning any noticeable effect I cant find the word trying to scribe all my thoughts bra among down it is much easier for me to describe the pictures in my head the vivid sensations I am accustomed to beholding within my minds own personal theater I have developed my own way of thinking so I like to think through day dreams and I images which I behold clearly even with my eyes open as if they happened in front of me I like to write but not this droning nonsense which may not rekey have the benefit of human eyes except for its execution and if it gets read I am told it might not be and it is this insignificance which repels me to the assignment at least its easy except for the internet part I have generally avoided this dismal institution for my years I spit upon the net when it first gained its genesis and I spit upon its multi-media machination which steals the waking li haves from people but what of it for that matter they do it to themselves I can not pity them for that if they like computers to sunsets let them use paintbrush to engineer their own nature but I prefer the real thing made of so much chaos and chance that these is ample number-crunchers couldnt make anything with that much sensation that much depth that is what lacks in these computers they are vicarious to life not that I condemn them they are useful tools and not that I condemn their junkies or pushers for the fact of the creation and not that I li have my life to its fullest potential as it may sound I condemn the computer junkies for not doing its just that I guess I have found my own niche in the wall of the world my own peaceful way of doing things that is inhibited by the computer only slightly in the way that I hate it and most embrace it I am hypocritical in this matter as well I own a computer myself and use it nearly every day I like to think probably falsely that my downfall in the machine is not so complete as those web-surfers who spend + hours browsing the electronic dreams of men but then my won mind produces the dreams I li have in whose to say which is worse?  I prefer to see pictures of the world inside my own mind and I can contra have any number of vicarious situation locations persons emotions sunsets anything I want with a near vivid copy of the real things my eyes behold is this the same as the infernal computer? is this any less debilitating a habit to daydream in ways even more real than my own insignificant life? I say insignificant and I mean it not in a degrading matter or that I do not feel I have made full use of my potential or that I want for a better standard or situation in my own life but that it is the truth that all humans are insignificant no matter how I important or influential save in the numbers of our I immense crowd I am sure philosophers have pondered the subject as I do right now for a useless computer but as I have mentioned I prefer the daydream I prefer the novel and I prefer the realistic sunset to a game of doom not to say that the particular pastime is not fun I am just as guilty as wasting an hour or so but I havent followed it up as many have with the endless assortment of clones that rock the computer gaming industry I am bored with writing this as though I think in words because normally I do not normally I prefer to think in sight in sound and even smell though thats a hard one to master I do not think I shall so now I think its time to stop this wonderment I have going and describe what I think about when I do not do it in words  flashing colors sometimes geometric-shapes until I can find something to build the energy in mind into I remember during psych class when I began to waver off which I am in habit of doing sometimes at the wrong moment daydreaming about my kendo class coming up soon I thought about a stalwart master standing over me as I held out a bamboo sword poised straight and steady I though about going over the moves I knew so well I am quite a fan of kendo and cannot wait to take the actual class I hope though that my daydream will predict some of the success I hope to have but I still recognize that it was not real only a contrivance and I will have to wait for the fact to see back tot he daydream I enjoy remembering and have thought about since I then I imagined as though I were past the class but somehow not in the real world as we know it but somewhere where the sword still ruled the land I think now it must have been my own idea of feudal japan but needlessly I walked around in nothing but a I forget now what the karate uniforms I have donned so many times are called but I was wearing one of those carrying a real sword this time trudging through muddy roads through a country side constantly lit by an orange pasty sun I cant remember where it went form there but needless to say much violence honor and success followed thats how my daydreams sometimes run but sometime they are more erratic sometime I let my mind go though I do have extension have control and watch bizarre unfoldings before me of pictures melting together sometimes a forgotten memory boiling up from the depths of my mind but more often a collage of unearthly landscapes I have done extension have travel in the southwest of our country sometimes willing sometimes not and have amassed a great many memories of the landscapes enough memories in fact to create my own realistically though vicariously through my daydream ability sometimes I I imagine titanous walls of huge cliffs eaten away by a rib hiver evidently but I impossibly showing the scores of rain as though it were eroded by that force alone topped with greenery though the valley below is of rocks and tumbled stones I like to visualize I like to visualize so much that on the last vacation I made special note to remember the best landscapes I saw and discovered in the process that I couldnt remember the scenes if I wore sunglasses without them I could remember the sharpness of shiprock the depth of the grand canyon the crumbling stones of Chaco and mesa Verde but with sunglasses on I found I could not remember the details they seemed clouded and sometimes distorted as thought he glass stole away the true definition of the pictures I wanted to remember that is the unfortunate part of my visualizing saga sometime I mar and twist my own memories into fantastic visages only seen in movies and then find I cannot twist them back sometimes I remember the waves at Galveston quite a bit larger then they really were the sun at the most vivid sunrise I recall that much brighter and golden though taken from the special effects house and spliced with my memory and I wonder which is better? to have the memory unaltered or to have the memory better I improved and refined into something so stunning to remember or think about that I might include it in stories thats how I write too do not think out the story I see though it were a movie flashing before my eyes I hear it though a speaker were plugged next to me I feel it though I were in it myself sometimes I think about conquering the world so much to the fact that I have it all planned out I feel safe writing about here because it is doubtful anyone will read this carefully or pay attention to it but I am confident enough of my long-term plans that I would feel bad if someone didnt have the warning maybe just fancy but we will se wont we? if not then ill die a normal life or maybe get a few books out and rekey have some fame not as much as id like the money though I am sure I have met the twenty minute interval but I forgot to check the clock so ill keep writing a little longer to be sure to satisfy the requirement so now I will daydream for sure and write it as I see it as though it were happening no I better not it would probably appear too much like my writings but I will go ahead and make-visualize a new landscapes like I did up there earlier because I enjoy it so much I see a rising pyramid sitting atop a four-cornered stone terrace that hold the point towards a sky with two suns one burning bright and vaguely familiar to our own the other a hazy blue color lazily sitting near the point surrounding it is the ruins of a city not Egyptian though but more reminiscent of the roman culture with tilted columns and ruble returning to the desert the sand is a yellow with glitter like mica flecks I embedded in the sand which is hot tot he touch but not ruff it runs like silk through the hands my hands? I do not know I just watch the valley surrounding is windswept though perhaps they must be my hand because it appears quite desolate the wind whips the sands into speeding wraiths across the amazingly flat area around somehow no dunes develop though I wonder how that could be I said valley but I do not see any moutons or hills around I wonder what prompted me to describe it as such if I were writing a book I would have changed it or added in a distant mountain line but not so here the sand seems compacted though to the foot though a hand can easily dislodge it though it seems to flow back into place it reminds me of the black sands of California more gray then black but equally as smooth and mica filled perhaps thats where its flintiness comes from a mixed memory of tv and actually physical things I have seen sometimes its is most times though it is merely illusion merely contrivance so I will let it go at that 
I feel weird I know I am about to pull an all nighter and I have this eternal sense of flux but I am not in anguish at all I am actually euphoric some how like I said I am feeling weird thats why I am doing thins now I do not know really what I am supposed to say but I guess it doesnt matter well I am kind of at a stand still I hope you can read all of my word I am a totally phonetic speller you see I am dyslexic how ever you spell it well ill just start talking then things are always weird well nothing is normal its not suppose to be that would be incredible boring and stagnate but its just we never know were we are and never know exactly what we want and even if were some were we never know is this really were I want to be is this what I want to do I guess it dont matter much were always were we are and were always how we are entail we change which is normally but different than how I usually am because its different but I am not indecision have I think I just question it all and I am yet to come up with the answer tired but awake I actually like this and I cant what to participate in the experi aments i am lazy and all i do is procrastinate thats why this allnighter thing is happening tired but wanting to do my work i actually get cote up in it when i actually do it i like working but i procrastinate theres all ways people to talk to and women to hit on and do not get me wrong i just need people my friend and especially the female ones i just need close people that all is there to be with and together nothing more the one but any way i get mad at my self for not doing what i need to in school because i actually like it all i love learning but i just cant put my ass in the chair and sit once i do i get it done and have fun doing it i still feel weird just lackadaisical and its one of the few times i feel like reading and studying even though i do like it when i do it i feel like i am giving you the wrong info just not what your looking for well sorry but it happens i think i want to do work because my body wants me to sleep and i am just procrastinating from that like usual its also why i am taking so long to do this its not reading its just like me sitting out side talking but i guess its enough and i hope it works for what you want so ill put me always phrase in here and say good bye  have fun   
writing about the stream of consciousness is really not my thing the only thing i understand is that i am suppose to put my feelings and thoughts as of now on paper well what i am feeling right now is tiredness last night i only had hours of sleep and i am really tired and sleepy right now i figure since i have time to kill i better do it completing an assignment that requires action and movement to keep me awake i am suppose to meet a friend for lunch at oclock and it is merely as i said before i really need a nice comfortable mattress so i can take a nap other than feeling really tired and lazy i am also feeling happy i am glad that i am where i am and grateful for my parent i realized that that last sentence really didnt make any sense oh well in a way i can blame the tiredness i have inside of me on myself and partially on my cousin i blame myself because i stayed up late on the phone talking to the friend that is taking me out to lunch today then i can blame my cousin because she wanted me to take her to get her i ammunization shot then what turns out is that the clinic we went to did not operate i ammunization which brings me now to understand that i am frustrated as well being that the clinic that we went to didnt do i ammunization i am going to have to wake up early again on a different day to bring her to another clinic i really really hate waking up early no matter what it is for it has to be pretty i amportant for me to get away from dreamland this seat that i am sitting on right now is really too high for me either that or i am really short the seat is so high that it has my legs hanging off the ground which really sucks because it is making my knees hurt they feel sore now the truth is is that i am really not that short i am so that is about average anyway i realize now that writing about your consciousness is really strange and something your think about at the spur of the moment trying to put every- thing down is kind of frustrating when you cannot type as fast as you think well the minutes are up and i have to run i do not want to bore the person who will be reading this although it is already boring as is

i lost interest of the situation but after a whole summer of not talking to her i started to miss her i had attempted to email her but she never responded i guessed that she was mad at me i have emailed her times with no reply but i am a persistent bastard so finally today in fact just before i opened this page i decided to check my email as i do every day and there was her email it explained that she had not checked her email all summer it may not be true but it works for me i proceeded to write her back thereby postponing this assignment around minutes i will eagerly await her reply as i basically demanded to see her well see if she accepts i never checked to see when i started this but i will keep on writing until i run out of shit to say i assume that cursing is not a problem i understand that this is a class full of nai have little freshmen but i think we are all mature enough to hear such profanities do not worry i wont go pornographic or anything but the instructions were to write what was on my mind and i am an avid cusser so i hope this will do that is if anyone actually reads this masterpiece of stream of conciousness writing now i am running out of things to say i like most of my classes my major is biochemistry i am years old i have brown hair blue eyes i like to play football watch football opening day is sunday i li have for football actually i like movies i am filling in space this is odd and i am going to stop now thank you kent 
not as much concentration nor as deep a thought i have always had a problem with being too easily distracted like now i just lost my train of thought i try to think about too many things at once and i do not really have a choice about what i think when i was doin the pretesting i often found that if any question required any thought or recoolection at all i was drawn a blank at it i si amply could not look deeply into what i saw i have related this problem to many possible sources - this is why i decided that i did not want to smoke marijuana it is also why i am thinking that i should not smoke it is possible that smoking could have a depressi have effect on the mind maybe i do not drink enough water or sleep too little or too much there really is no way to know for certain i should probably just lead the best life that i know how instead of the easiest which is what i do i know there are things i need to get done things that i do which are just wasting my time and things that i know are just plain wrong but i always reason my way around these issues or rather i just stop myself from thinking about them it really cannot be good to be like this - i am feeling like i inhaled a little too much glue - actually i am probably just using the computer too much by continuously focusing on an external source of entertainment right in front of me i feel that i am rotting my brain this assignment is not helping either because i am not allowed to stop and think about things - once again i am si amply functioning on the basest level possible i like the movie the stand a lot and i have read the entire book once and the first half two more times i never really can finish it but this last time that was because i decided that reading was bad for me in all honesty it is probably better for me thatn enything else i do because it might encourage deep thought i should probably also listen to music without words - one is forced to think deeply with that because there is nothing else really for your mind to do i listen to the play les miserables all the time now - and it is interesting because it is a very sad play - in a way it makes me sadder than anything i feel like i would cry if i would ever cry but i never do i cry maybe once every year or two and it is usually for something silly the last time i cried sincerely was when highschool ended i had just listened to i will remember you the sound they played at graduation i also saw grease and st elmos fire both of which remind me of high school soon after i cried quite a bit over the loss of something which i didnt really care about in the first place i think it is because i have never liked the end of anything and the end of highschool is much like the end of the first section of you life although there is a marginal change from elementary to junior high and junior high to high school they are still organized schools in the public school system often ever within the same school district every day at am you get up to prepare for school which you are required to go to at there are tardies and classes and a bell and teachers that know your name lunch is in a cafeteria at a specific time and there is a meal of the day that you must pay your  or  for it is really all the same thing just twelve different grades in the same school college is more like a job than like the old school system - it is a huge change i si amply hope that my friends do not go crazy and decide to move off or something after college this would be the death of me because i will not can not and do not want to make new friends however i have found that no contact with friends slowly dri haves me mad i would love for me jere and nolan and robert to stay local forever i would like them all to but i do not see how i could li have without at least robert and nolan jeremy and robert mark and robert robert and ben jeremy and ben jeremy and mark therse combinations would be able to keep me satisfied for just about forever of course you know the freakin psychos will all go off and get married like the sick bastards that they are they should read a little bit of saint paul the fools he knew the wisdom about not getting married that was one of the things that pissed me off about your pretest it asked is my shyness interfered with my dating or something like that no my shyness does not interfere with my freaking dating cause i do not date i never will date i barely ever have dated and i think that people who do date should be lined up and flogged until they come to their senses in my junior year people always used to say well craig you are just bitter cause you cant get any well at the time that was partially true but since then i have had opportunity galore in my senior year jana the cheer leader heather myriah jill and melissa all openly admitted that they liked me did i pursue? did i? well i admit i foolishly wen out with jana worst mistake of my life btw but no one can say that i cant get any no sir there was a girl on my floor last year that may have liked me the only girl i have bothered to meet in all of college so far peopl also say well just wait until you meet the right person craig - then you will change your mind well who are they kidding? i already said that i had no interest in meeting any people at all i have met basically zero peopl since i have been in college i met my roommate and i briefly spoke to nero and christina i think that was her name but that is it i have met no one in my classes nor do i have any remote interest in meeting them once last year a girl called me up to ask me to study with her highly possible that she was interested in me as well but i had no interest in doing so i sat there in terror hoping that she wouldnt ask me to study with her for i would have to turn her down which i hate to do that will probably how i will end up getting hitched i just wont be able to say no i am terrible at that 
it was an awesome meal went to chuys the best chicken enchiladas i have ever had my friend jay came to visit out of the clear blue just showed up at my door today i was pretty excited about seeing hi am i really miss san antonio i miss my family a lot talked to my mom today she says how much they all miss me there and how empty the house is without me whatever i am the one in a claustrophobic dorm room living with a complete stranger at least they still have each other i am the one on my own do not get me wrong i love the freedom of living on my own its just a little bit hard to make the transition at first especially if youre as close to your family as i am all of my really close friends are at am thats weird my two best friends from the first gradewe all used to li have on the same streetgo to school there and complain that they miss me at least they are together i have a lot of friends here and a lot of people i knowi never run out of things to dobut it just is not the same do not have that bond with other friends oh well make new friends but keep the old i met a really cool girl the other day shes in my rtf class man that class is so huge people i am so worried about doing well in that class cause its my major and i really want to make an a in there the ta said that none of us would do as well as we think we will on the first test great that makes me feel good about it it is really interesting though i hope i picked the right major though its such a competiti have field i want to do really well not just push a camera around for big stars for the rest of my life i want to be one of the big stars that would be a dream come true wow i do not even really know what i want to do with my degree yet sometimes i think that thats cool and that i am only and i do not need to know all of that stuff just yet then again i am in school and my parents are paying a lot of money for my education i do not want to disappoint them and become one of those drifters who cant decide what they want to do until they have already been in college for like ten years and by then theyre too old to get a really awesome job anyway cause all the younger smarter kids are getting them first that would not be good then i think i am dwelling on it entirely too much and i should just enjoy college get the education i came here for and get on with my life just sort of go with the flow i do not normally stress out but when i sit alone and actually think about it for a while it all becomes sort of scary you know where i am in life where i am going where am i going? thats the hard partand its sort of excitingis not knowing the future not knowing what is going to happen from day to day we just take life as it comes i have a class at nine in the morning it is so freaking hard to wake up for that class every monday wednesday and friday i am really proud of myself cause i havent missed a single day of class yet a lot of people i know have been skipping out its so easy to do but not me even when it was pouring rain outside i still went to class soaking wet i am so concerned about doing well 
looking at this assignment i am trying to think freely but it is constantly in my mine that i want a good grade like every other student i do not like doing homework but i writing so it is okay i have been writing papers all day because the teachers have been craming us with homework all weekend because od a long weekend i know i should have done this earlier but i am a procrastinator and i often wait until the last minute i am slowly changing that habit because i know i cant procrastinate if i want to do good in school my feelings towards this paper is kind of wierd because i do not know what i am suppose to be feeling i am just writing what comes to my mind honestly i do not even understand the topic all i know is that i am suppose to write non stop for twenty minutes and put down anything that comes to my mind i know this has nothing to do with school but i keep thinking about my girlfriend back in houston i was suppose to see her this weekend but her parents wouldnt let her come up to austin it is okay because i know ill see her next weekend i was going to write this earlier like on friday but my friends came to visit me and stayed here for the weekend so i didnt find time to write this assignment so far i like the class because it is the only one that interests me all my other classes are boring the is the only class that i enjoy the lectures in i am not saying this just to make the professor happy i am saying this because i mean it i am running out of things to write about because nothing is coming up to mind right now oh yeah i think the experi aments are a good idea because the students get to do something fun in order to earn their grade i thought about writing the research papper because i think that might be easier but i think the experi aments would be funner i have met some people in class and they seem to be pretty nice i also met some of my friends that i already knew who came here from houston just like me i have no idea what this writing is for nut since the teacher ask us to do it i am i do not know how long i have been writing because things have been just coming into my mind i thought i would be watching the time a lot but it is suprising me that i am not i just keep writing until i do not know what else to write well things are starting to stop coming into my mind all i am thinking about is how i can make this paper keep going longer without me having to stop will i think my feelings for the past twenty minutes have been exciting anxious lost suprise and not understanding this has been a interesting paper because i have no idea what i have been writing well i guess ill push the submit button now 
i do not really want to do this assignment i think its tedious and i want to go to sleep i havent had much rest lately but socializing with my friends is i amportant to me too i want to study but i am totally lost at what i want to do because i have so much work to do i think i will study psychology first before i study my ee book i miss my brother hes so cool looking around the room it feels full but empty at the same time this music in the background is cool i am glad i burned the cd today i hope my dorm mates do not get mad that i am turning it up so loud i do not really care that much though i want to go do something besides work everyone around here is studying but i am not i feel like i am forgetting to study for something i wish i went to see that movie last night it sounded really cool my neighbors are great but i do not know if their real or fakes i am so cynical i do not understand why i do not trust anyone i wish i could trust people more but i think i trust too much already i do not know i think i am going to call an old friend today see if he wants to do something houston seems so far away from here i miss my family i do not understand why people do not miss their family here i seem to be the only one i try to call them everyday but it seems like the telephone conversations is not enough i want them to be near me the houses around here look really beat up and old maybe they should li have a little farther away the concert i went to was pretty cool i had a good time it was strange off all the concerts i went to this one had a lot of good looking girls it must be the type of music it is i wish my taste in music was more targeted to good looking girls but i hate the music those girls listen to its so bad i do not understand how they can listen to such garbage man my trash can is full when i am done i think ill throw out the trash why do people keep leaving garbage in here its not just us i hope that my computer does not crash again its built well but i seem to be slacking off on computer studying i do not know as much as i did or wish to i love computers so much though i wish i could be rich like those million or billionaires but then again i do not want to be too greedy maybe if i could just provide enough for my family i think i wouldnt like to be rich maybe just comfortable and liking what i do i hope ee is what i like to do my decision making ability is really putrid i do not think i like writing this my hands are getting kinda strained i think i am going to go and throw away the trash oh wait i still have another assignment to do wow i am glad i remembered to do this assignment i do not want a bad grade only weeks into the school year okay i think i want to finish this up thank you for listening to my psycho-babble i hope it benefits you more than it ever did for me okay i think ill stop now bye 
i really miss all of my people back home i really miss ki am i wish she would take me back i miss having her around to hold me and make me feel happy i really really miss being happy i cant seem to do it on a regular basis without her why did she break up with me i still realy do not understand i was very good to her lacey said i was her favorite out of all of ki ams boyfriends seems like that says something but i guess not were still broken up and i do not see that changing any time soon excpet i wonder what that big long letter was going to be about i find that very interesting could she have written about how much she misses me and wants me back who knows hell i may never know and thats the problem i really want to know i want her to be honest with me about everything that goes through her mind about me i would love if she would just write down every thought she ever has about me and just tell me that would make things so much easier for me it may hurt sometimes but at least i would know that would make me feel a lot better i really hope she writes me back to tell me what that letter said it bothers me that i cant know i wish she wouldnt have even told me that she had written that damn thing now its going to be on my mind all the time at least until she tells me what it said or at least what it was about thats all i want to know i want to know if it said she wanted to get me back or if she never wanted to talk to me again i think she still wants to talk to me cause i know she cares about me lacey told me that and i know that but i just want to know what it said and i want to know what kathryn was talking about when she said that brad and john said they were talking about how i stalked ki am when could i have done that?? i was out of town so its pretty i ampossible that i could have stalked someone miles away i wonder if ki am thinks that i stalk her i do not know how she could think that its really silly to think that someone would think that but kathryn said that brad may have told her that just to make her happy why would it make kathryn happy that i stalk ki am even though i do not i guess cause now kathryn knows that someone hurt me as bad as i hurt them oh well forget that idea kathryn and i are friends now so it shouldnt matter that i got hurt by ki am it should make kathryn sad when i am sad i know it does cause she told me when she called me to see how i am doing so i know that brad was lying now ki am never thought i was stalking her if she did why would she still talk to me i just wish that when she talks to me she would say that she wants me back just like in that damn song when i go fishing for the words i am wishing you would say to me i am really only praying that the words youll soon be saying might betray the way you feel about me yeah thats how it is for me since i think she does not want me back yet it would be such a good thing if she did even though i would see her about once a month and we are miles apart oh well cest la vie i could deal with that just to know that she is committed to me thats all i really want from her i just want to know that she is committed to me this sucks royal ass that shes probably out running around with hundereds of guys and i am here being miserable if i ever found out that she was i would just go crazy i wouldnt be able to deal with that at all that would push me over the edge like i am not close enough already even now that i am here all i do is think about her i have thought about her too much i should be trying to find someone here that i can be like that with bt i really cant i wouldnt mind meeting that vollyball player that alex was telling me about she sounds really cool if it was her that i saw today with that coach then shes really hot and shes a christian too so that would help me if she was plus she li haves a lot closer than ki am or wendy or julie or erica that would make things so much easier on me i would really like to fall for this girl then i could get my mind off of ki am if she does not come back to me then i need to get my mind off her but its too hard i loved her too much i still do thats what sucks so much but what can i do not a thing in the world i can love her all i want but if she does not love me then its all worthless that bothers me to death this is my first day of class and all i can think about is her i liked my classes today i have homework in every one of them i should be thinking about that but i am still thinking about her thank god my time is almost up on this thing my wrists are getting tired and my fingers too this is really ridiculous but i do see the point in it though times up bye 
at this particular moment i am considering whether or not i should have started this stream of consciousness thing or whether i should be cooking some food since i am pretty hungry i am not sure it was a good idea for me to have started this knowing that i have to keep typing for another minutes or so hopefully my stomach will hold out long enough other than that i am wondering why you are having us do this assignment is it like the experi amental research that is required are some of our samples going to be used in some psychological theory? or is this for our benifit will i come to some startling realizations about how my mind works that will totally change my life? well tracking what i have written so far it appears that my priorities are food and other necessities then i go on to question the purpose of this assignment it appears that whoevers hierarchy idea was correct i am thinking mavlov but i might be wrong any way he said that once the basic needs were taken care of then the person should work on the higher needs such as love and peace and democracy and all that but untill everyone can be secure in an environment with their needs provided for them they will not be to worried about the finer things in life or be able to attain them for that matter for that matter for that matter i do not even know what for that matter means i guesse it means also what a waste of words wow i am also noticing that i have stopped using propper pronunciation cool i guesse thats the assignment so who am i to argue hmmmm  pronunciation is a waste of time a constriction gets in the way of us getting our thoughts onto a hyperlinked web page i suppose the brain does not think in pronunciation but it sure helps everyone else if the writings are organized in one particular manner anyway i do not really care about that too much i think the real reason for this assignment is so that we will get comfortable with this set up i am sure the real objecti have will be revealed in a later assssignment this is just getting us used to it and able to pour our thoughts over teh keyboard in a somewhat coherent if illogical way why am i so interested in teh purpose? hmm maby i should just do it and not care what teh purpose is maby ignorance is bliss maby this is a psychological evaluation by the fbi to determine if i am eligible to be a programmed assasin like mel gibson in conspiracy theory ironic that was a consppiracy therory of my own coincidence ? ill let whoever reads this thing if anyone decide like i said before i need to make some food because i am hungry i know i am supposed to do this for minutes but i wasnt really keeping tracki of time but since i type faster and think faster than the aaverage person i am sure that i put enough stuff down to count yeah proba ly so proavba lj asdflja probably so 
i am supposed to be writing from my stream of consciousness i guess ill find out how random my thinking is as if i didnt already know i really like this cd too bad this is his only one i wonder what cd i should listen to next i should try to call janet again i really want her to come visit me up her i know how much she likes austin i am really glad that i didnt buy those tickets for the chemical brothers since now i have a math test that night i wonder when the concert starts i really do want to go and the concert is the day after my birthday it would be a present to myself plus i have been waiting years for them to play in texas i really like this song this room is rather boring we definitely need to get some more stuff on the walls i have to make a list of stuff to pick up when i go home otherwise i will forget everything and i do not know when ill be going home again i think ill listen to semisonic next i havent listened to that cd in awhile i am glad i decided to bring the cd with me today is deidres birthday and allisons i should send allison a card i wonder if kisha got the one i sent her i need to get a prepaid calling card so i can talk to her she needs to come visit me too i should probably email her again this bed is so hard its making my back hurt but i have to admit its not quite as hard as the one i had during orientation you would think the mattress would gi have some after having so many people sleeping on it i miss my bed at home its so comfy wow there are a lot of people walking by all of a sudden i think that this is one of the coolest assignments i have gotten in a long time its much better than all the busy work i had to do last year my mom will be happy to know that i like my psychology class i wont be talking about music all the time ill actually have something related to my major to tell her well i think thats been my minutes of truly intelligent thinking 
i really hope my parents let me get a motorcycle it would be so much easier getting around campus if i had one versus driving a car and having to park two miles away and walk the rest of the way in one hundred degree heat i would be the perfect candidate for a motorcycle i never speed i do not have a single traffic violation and i have been driving for two years i am a very defensi have dri haver and it is the perfect thing to get arounf in at u t if i do get a motorcycle i am going to get a kawasaki ninja zx-r it is a perfect bike for me because it is not to big but it is still just as fast as the larger displacement bikes practicality is a big plus but it would also be nice to have a nice bike to dri have around campus i think i deserve the motorcycle because the rest of my friends all have very nice things and i am the highest achieving out of all of them all my friends have brand new cars and trucks but i got a super used old piece of junk i know i am going to buy all the things i never had when i make a lt of money which hopefully will be within a couple of years a lot of people tell me that u t engineers especially electrical engineers which is what i amcan make very good money while they are still in college with internships and summer jobs or my parents would gi have me the money they had saved up for college if i could get a company to pay for the remainder of my college by signing an agreement to work for them for a gi haven amount of time my electrical engineering mentor whom also is an honors student said he made six thousand dollars a month for the summer after his sophomore year if i could make that much and i was still having fun like i am now i would stay and get my masters in either engineering or business because if i could make fifty to seventy thousand a year my first year out of college who knows how much i could make with an advanced degree i would spend so much money on my parents to try to show how thankful i am for putting me in the position i am i would also spoil myself as well i would have the finest clothes the fastest cars and the most material things i also enjoy the fact that after four years of electrical engineering i should be a pretty intelligent person whom hopefully capable of law shcool grad school or beyond  
the day has flown by work computer science homework but it was a nice day i was wearing black which was dumb because the sun was shining and it was really hot u know about how black seems to attract the most colors or that the most colors get absorbed so it actually makes everything hotter plus i was wearing jeans which made it worse i would have actually preferred to wear shorts but going to work on the first day wouldnt have been smartest with dressing so casually know what i mean? but anyways back to the point i met some interesting people today i talked to kevin for a while actually only a couple of sentences i had to go soon but i wanted to go to the ta to see if he can help me with my cs homework turned out he wasnt there do not know where he went but i do not care tho actually i did u know how things seem to be worse when nothing seems to be going ur way? well its almost quiet right now i think the crickets are chirping which is horrible because its really annoying typically i am not a violent person but its something about crickets i have no idea i do not know what it is sarah is asking what it is and she was checking to see if it was the ac i hope that the crickets arent in the room its like frogs croaking at nite before u go to sleep or the heater going on but its hard to concentrate with all that noise but i think i can manage anyways what was i talking about? oh yeah my cs homework i came back from work and just asked eric for some help since he has a computer i went at around one thirty becuase i came back at around one from work grabbed my computer and talked to kevin and then went down to blanton to see marty play the piano i just asked hi am to come with me to painter good finally the chirping has stopped some guy is banging on the ac poor crickets but its finally stopped cool anyways i went to the dorm room in jester which was a fifteen minute walk fifteen minutes sometimes is a long way but not when ur determined fifteen minutes is to gregory gym which is good but sometimes when i am walking to rlm it seems like itll take forever and i am just fi have minutes away why does it seem to be so far? i needed to take a break sometimes which is totally weird oh well hmm theres a coke can around me and its been there for a couple of nites actually only around three days or around two martin got it for me the day before and i just decided to leave it in the fridge i should probably just recycle it the recycling bin is not that far away only like a two second walk actually around one minute more or less gi have or take a few its near the trashcan and stuff its kept in the washing room it has a washing machine and a dryer and also it has like a sign-up sheet so that people can get to it easier instead of waiting u just take a time period of around three hours u know? anyways its an iron board in there and a broom and mop which reminds me that the room is getting dirty looking at the computer it looks really cool its miniature i almost didnt want to get it because sony is discontinuing it and u know i thought there was something with it i do not know u know that most people do not want stuff thats going out but this is a silver and metallic purple color i was at work for an hour just sorting out papers of different colors there was buff metallic orange canary yellow and all these various colors which is strange because there are the brites and the normal colors which are paler but i am already done so guess this is the end 
hmm lets see what to write about since were on the topic of psychology i was in awe when i first walked into the auditorium the first day of class there were more people in that room than in my entire graduting class last year it was a pretty i ampressi have sight but also a bit omnious so far i like my classes but all of them are bigger than my highschool classes but then again what am i supposed to expect with a school population of near people as opposed to my high school population man i like this internet homework this way you do not have to worry about keeping up with papers and the like i used to loose most of my homework back in the day because i am not that organized of a person speaking of internet you got to love this internet hookup in the dorm rooms i like the fact that i can be in the internet and still have the phone line free my parents used to hate when id tie up the phone line checking my e-mail since all my friends went to different colleges its amazing how handy e-mail really is i have already talked to a few of them using some aol instant messanger its kind of funny really to see how many of your old high school friends keep in touch over the school year or keep in touch at all for that matter i have been in contact with some of my good friends but also been surprised at not hearing from or close ones i think i decided that i am going back for our high schools homecoming on sept supposedly a lot of my friends are going to and id really like to see them i am also going back this next weekend labor day weekend seems that i forgot to pack a lot of stuff or didnt even thing of stuff that i ended up needing in college i guess in a way its kind of hard to pack for moving away because you do not know exactly what youll need until you get there it must seem to you by now that i am relating a lot of stuff back to high school well do not go over analyzing it or anything its just what i am basing a lot of my college experiences on so far its funny i never had to read or study back in high school it just sort of came to me naturally through teacher lectures but here i am actually having to adjust and take notes read the book etc having to pull a is weird but i think i am doing a good job so far man i hope my laundrys not done yet i still have a few more minutes go to writing but i just hate it when people put their stuff in the dryer or washer and leave only to come back an hour later when theres a huge line forming to use it heh i guess i should start practicing what i preech but i figure i have got tons of time to start doing that most likely ill start when i get out of schoo get married and have kids so i do not set a bad example yeah i eventually want to have kids and i stress eventually i have got so many good one liners that i have inherited from my parents along with a few that i thought up all on my own that i cant wait to try out on my youngins hmm i seem to have a bit of a problem i forgot when i started typing my mindless babbling i think i still have a few minutes left this assignment reminds me of a book i had to read last year in english well i didnt have to because i didnt but we were supposed to it was a portrait of an artist as a young man i remember it because the author used a lot of stream of conciousness in the book which made it harder to follow and understand thus less appetising to me to read i did however download the cliffs notes off the internet and read those so i guess i didnt totally slack off i just took a shortcut ok i think my sentence is served so i am going to go check on my laundry 
what should i write hmmm well i am kinda feeling tired right now and hungry went bolwing till about am last night and havent really had anything to eat yet in about an hour me and a few people from the dorm are going out to a vietnamesse restaurant to eat since all the cafeterias are closed for dinner on sunday i hear people talking in the hallway about going to play paint ball on monday i think i am going to go i have never played paint ball but i have heard its pretty cool hopefully it wont last that long because i was planning on doing some reading for my classes something always comes up to keep you from studying oh and i have calculus homework to do also damn my calculus teacher is french and has not mastered the english language but really who has in the mathematics department tuesday is a busy day so i do not think ill get much done then all the clubs i signed up for meet on tuesday there are fi have days in the week and lets say take out friday to make four possible days to have a meeting and they all choose the same day just my luck ill just have to choose which oraganization seems the best hm well is my minutes up yup 
this assignment is kind of hard i am not used to just writing doen wat comes to me i am sitting here trying to write every thought in my head but my mind seems to go blank when i do not want it to and runs a million miles a minute when i am trying to pay attention in class i should be in clarksville with friends a beer and bbq i need to go skate more school is to time consuming i do not even know if i really want to do it the work is frustrating i do not mind going to class but i hate all the outside reading and homework its not even that i dislike reading i just want to read what i want to read not some course related book the story of b is one of the most intriguing books that i have ever read and i havent even gotten through / of it yet maybe i like it so much because of the character hes not sure of many things and thats exactly how i feel i want to be liked but at the same time i hate contact with most people i think most people arent worth talking to theyre dumb they have nothing to say its pointless people suck writng this out is strange these are things i should keep to myself because i do not even know if i truly believe what i am saying or if i am just getting angry again i do get angry to much maybe i should quit smoking i know i should but its hard i had no problem on the trip but that was because i couldnt get any i just cant do it around the ville we smoke to much for sure throwing money away but fuck money i sit here and stress on how much money i take out of my savings and then in the same instant say to myself i do not gi have a fuck about money fuck money i should have been born a long time ago when you provided for yourself and if you couldnt hunt of fish then you were in trouble fuck vegetarians self righteous think that because they do not eat meat they are somehow above me fuck that if we didnt eat meat id die i need to stop worrying about girls so much to i always say i do not gi have a fuck whether i am seeing anyone or not but i am always thinking about girls typical i need to get out on my own and figure all these things out i should not worry so much but i do at least i have music and my boys and skateboarding who cares i do not go out as much i still love it just as much at least i think i still do but i can definitely see myself drifting away its probably because i smoke to much that shit kills you your energy and your dri have yet i love it so much and i cant quit obviously this is a big thing to me because i am always stressing on it and fuck stress wwhereever it comes from i wish i could destroy stress does nothing except cause problems i try to be stress free but its i ampossible especially with school always looming over how much do i reaaly want to go to school i do not know i know i could go and make a living without school and maybe i shoul because i am tired of getting all this knowledge that is not applicable to anytihng outside of ut of course the shit is expanding my mind and view of the world right fuck that i li have in texas and i do not really care about to many other places why should i 
i have a headache i took some excederine a few minutes ago i am tired after four days off i was out of the habit of going to school i feels good to be home this assignment is odd i am full my head is hurting again with a dull pain this time tuesday night nothing good comes on tv i have to watch satellite shows some people did this assignment in the first day of class i guess it is hard to find anything to do when you move away from home i am glad i decided to li have at home but i am afraid i am missing out on meeting new friends sometines i feel like an outsider on campus but i wouldnt have made friends easily either i would just sit around study and be bored i wish i was more outgoing i want to speak to people and make new friends but it is one of the hardest things to do speaking to strangers i want to but my own inhibition stops me it is funny how you can want very badly to do something but someting inside you stops you from doing it this is really helping my typing like in high school typing class high school was generally a good time i had trouble meeting people there also i was time to graduate more would have been ridiculus i waited until people would make an effort to meet me rather than be proacti have i should approach people myself like i intended to do today but couldnt ut is a big place i have a lot of concerns i like chemistry and welch hall but i am a business major business majors earn more money i want to buy a house and a new car on my own break away rom my parents but i am not ready to leave home starting high school depressed me i am afraid i will hate business i think gods plan was for me to be a scientist but i am taking all the wrong courses common sense tellw me to major in business but my gut feeling is science there are no easy answers i can be a judge which is cool i do not think i think fast enough on my feet to be a lawyer drafting documents i can do a masters in business would provide as many opportunities a law school but with law i get a license and a doctors degree is prestige that i amportant sometimes lawyers carry a stigma i do not want to seem overeducated to work in business but its now or never it is too hard to decide what to do in life i am afraid i am making all the wrong decisions time is up i like this assigment 
i am a bit in wonderous as to what is supposed to be accomplished by this writing assignment and what it is supposed to prove i hope this is not some wierd psychoanalysis of who i am or something like that not that i am an x-files junkie and i think this is one big conspiracy or anything though that is not one of the best shows about conspiracies anyway i really enjoyed conspiracy theory with mel gibson and julia roberts though right now i am thinking that i could be doing other homework that is a little bit more consequential for my classes tomorrow and just start typing random letters with little regard to this assignment but i am an honest and will continue to do this assignment as if someone were really going to read it i am really excited about the astros victory tonight over the phillies because it put us games ahead of the reds who split their double header today if the astros end up in the playoffs i plan on making at least one trip to houston to watch them play in the astrodome especially since that will probably be the last time i will khave a chance to see a game played in the astrodome after this season they will be playing in their new stadium by the convention center i think the convention center is a bit of a waste since houston does not seem to land many consequential national level events there but thats houston for you they never seem to get the kind of national coverage that new york or la gets i guess that is because it is considerably smaller but still i think it has to do with houston being a bit excluded from the rest of the country and with the lack of national events and tourism people will continue to think texas is all about cowboys and cattle wtith a few oil ranchers thrown in th e mix 
i cant believe i am doing this assignment should be asleep right now i wish that my roommate would quit playing his music my other roommate is a dork hes always talking about god and crap and telling me that i shouldnt drink and this and that fuck hi am hes no better than me hes just as bad in other ways i really hate it when all his friends come over here its like fucking chinatown thats what my whole dorm is like just a bunch of asians and arabs except for the nd floor all the people on that floor seem to be white and thats where all the hot girls are i need to get on that floor i should have just li haved in towers that would have been better speaking of hot girls i wonder what stephanie is doing right now i really should call her and try and hook up with her i cant tell if she is putting me off or if shit really keeps coming up that she has to do instead of going out with me but oh well that girl susan is really nice and she seems genuinely interested but its hard to tell but she does have really nice tits why did i just write that whoever is grading this is going to think that i am just a perverted moron but thats not true i do not know why people think that about me but it really pisses me off in fact nothing pisses me off more than when people think i am stupid especially when i am smarter than that person that really sucks that vinny testaverde is out for the season the jets are going to suck this year and i cant believe that the cowboys won today that was just unbelievable i wonder if my pledge brothers were watching the game i really hate my pledge brother nayel that guy seems so shady if hes not acting like a greedy little son of a bitch hes acting like a fucking tool that should be nayels new nickname tool oh well its been minutes and i am tired of doing this so no more words goodbye 
well here we are at last writing the writing assignment been putting it off for too many days now got to take that class on procrastination from the learning center might be useful only fi have seconds up got minutes+ more to go wonder if hell read all this stuff hope not or i am definitely getting into one of his crazy guy experi aments wonder if they have experi aments to test if a guy is crazy or not who knows? i might even get paid for being a lunatic god got so much to do in so little time havent touched my books and already i have a quiz tomorrow hope i do well in it ahhh two minutes up maybe this thing wont last as long as i thought after all got to call up my friend to see if shell have dinner with me i hate eating alone though most of the time i do eat alone on second thoughts i sort of do not mind eating alone at all its just that halfway through the meal when i see all the people talking to their friends and all that i find myself with no one to talk to oh well who cares anyways once i get settled here ill definitely have someone to eat with everyday so i better enjoy the solitude while it lasts hmmm what do i wear for todays meeting hope shes there man i got to shave too one more thing i keep putting off only six minutes up shit i better type a lil slower wanted to complete at least part of my assignment today but looks like its not going to happen though i can still try to do it have to come back from the meeting and do it i miss my friends used to have so much fun together three times a week to the computer course that was fun miss those days and miss those times wonder if ill ever be able to be so happy again well being sad about it does not help anyone so forget it do not know where i got this sudden opti amism from but its doing wonders to my life not to mention making me more popular and that had definitely helped my lonely little self to be more sociable but more is still needed why i like to be alone i have no idea but it just happens and i do not mind it my friends sense my depression my loneliness but they do not know how to cure it which as a matter of fact neither do i yeah baby we should definitely have more assignments like this helps the workload by a lot though if my finger keeps hurting like this i am a goner damn that hurts maybe if i type a little slower or not type at all ouch got to gi have it some rest but i cannot because i have to do this assignment if any person ever reads this thingy i apologize for my abbreviations but i am a regular chatter so i have to keep the words down otherwise my finger gets the way it is rite now only a few more minutes left now and i am free wonder how they grade people on this? who gets an a and who does not?? should i curse more to make it look real or should i just write what comes into my head well what comes into my head would be better since this thingy is about who cares anyways he wanted me to write what comes into my head i did so there 
hmmmm what am i going to write for my stream of consciousness i do not even know if i spelled that word right oh well i guess i just write whatever comes into my head by the way i have to fill out my daily schedule for my edp class do not forget about that its kind of hard to type whatever comes into my head because my hands arent as fast as my thoughts thats obviously a good thing whats on my mind this is a lot harder than i thought sometimes there is absolutely nothing in my head and i just draw a blank nothing to write about i wish that i can draw pictures on this thing but i cant i tend to be a more visual person and i get a lot more pictures in my head than words i think i am going a bit over twenty minutes although it does not seem like it i just sit here at my computer and think sometimes because i want something to pop in my head so i can write it down but nothing happens it seems like when you want your mind to wander it has a harder time doing it but if youre trying to concentrate on something like when youre taking a test your mind cant stop wandering i guess thats the amazing thing about the brain so unpredictable at least to the untrained individual who does not know what to look for it seems unpredictable maybe not so much for an expert its funny how the mind works anyway i do not want to get all philosophical or psychological or anything so i think that my time is up until next time ooohhh my arm itches 
the first sensation i feel while beginning writing is the hard carpet of the dorms at dobie on my elbows because i am lying on the ground with my laptop but then again at least the floors arent wooden like the floors at the other dorms so i really shouldnt be complaining also my eyes are burning because i am tired and want to go to sleep i sleep a lot less in college because during the day theres constant noise and people and its so much more fun to walk out in the hallway or go to the lobby and talk to people and see whats going on than to sit in my room and study and since i do not study and do homework during the day i do it late at night when there are no distractions if i stayed at jester id go to the library to get work done but i am too lazy to walk from dobie to jester this assignment is pretty easy and a whole lot better than sitting and doing my calculus homework which i have yet to do but i just looked at the clock on my laptop and its only been minutes since i have started and seconds was when i got up to get a pillow to put under my elbows my eyes are tearing now i do not know if tearing is a word but theyre getting watery from staring at this computer screen too long i am supposed to continue writing for minutes straight and say whats on my mind and what i feel?? what if all i can think about is how i wish i was in bed i think its the music i am listening to thats putting me to sleep its trance music because thats what i have downloaded on my computer from napster i hope they do not shut down napster the courts are right about how the people who actually made the music my roommate just called i got all excited that my phone rang this late at night i am not a nerd its just that i think its this guy i know in okok back to napster the people who make the music do not get their share and i understand and napster really should be shut down but i do not want it to because its so nice to just type in the name of a song and there you have it especially when theyre old songs you havent heard for a while i love music all kinds of music its the coolest feeling when a song brings back memories or reminds you of people and events its and i have to stop at i hope i am doing this assignment right because its too fun its kind of like a diary maybe this could be our final??? does the professor even read these essays that people write because i cant i amagine reading something essays about absolutely nothing even though those are the best kind kind of like seinfeld a show about nothing that everybody loves the music i am listening to makes me think of illegal drugs this is the kind of stuff people listen to when theyre on ecstasy it enhances the experience i wonder why people need other things to have fun i understand it but the world would be a better place if all the drugs were wiped off the face of the earth but if that was going to happen you might as well get rid of alcohol too and nicotine and sugar and caffeine or anything that alters the mind which is just ridiculous everythings here for a reason i do not understand how people first invented and figured out stuff about drugs i understand it when they grow out of the ground but stuff like pills how were they invented did someone just put a lot of stuff together and try it and they found a combination that worked??? i am scared for my younger sister shes in the th grade and theres so much going on now with drugs and all its everywhere you go and when shes my age it will probably be so much worse and so readily available and curiosity is such a crazy thing and no matter your willpower no matter what people always told you you still want to try and all the things we learn in elementary school about what to do and what not to do i think they bring in the whole forbidden fruit issue i remember in th grade thinking how can something be so powerful that it can make you do things you never would and make you steal from friends and make you feel so good that you would do anything to get it i would try it just once i can just i amagine my little sister thinking like that and you cant even shelter anyone anymore because its everywhere you cant take her out of one school and put her in another because itll still be there rich school or poor minority or strictly white it scares me to think about our generation in years because i can just see the damaged brains and the lung cancer and cirrhosis of the li haver yuck i am not even tired anymore because thinking about stuff like this gets me excited and ready to argue with someone my twenty minutes are almost up and i could talk forever about whats on my mind i always think about a lot of things which is not really good because i can never fall asleep ok thats time for calculus 
its hard to think about what to write of when you are told to although maybe its hard because things have become more difficult as of late it must be the typical freshman story but even though we all try to be so different when we come here we all end up in the same boat it so much like high school its hard to believe well the social part of it is anyway sometimes i wonder what i would do if there werent music in the world at times it seems to be the only thing that keeps people together although you never hear many people talk about it in that light what is even more interesting is how depressing and sentimental most of these essays will be i wonder how many people will write about how depressed they are and how no one really knows the real them and how hard it is to wake up in the morning its hard to differentiate between what is real and what is a line out of a movie that someone is saying these days so maybe thats why everyone tries to be different i really do not know but as everyday passes it seems like people lose a sense of the beauty in the world there is not anything much more beautiful to me than the sunset or just sitting outside i find shadows especially beautiful i am sure that it holds some underlying meaning to it that i find shadows pretty something about how since i like them that i feel that i am in the shadows of life but maybe i am i just feel more ali have sometimes when i sit outside in absolute stillness and let everything li have around me i feel as if i am living with it strange i know but true i have always felt that if i were to die i would like to die lying in a field in the afternoon listening to music i have a picture by monet that reminds me of a field that was behind my house when i was younger it seems that those times were so much better than times are now i wonder if ill ever be as happy as i was back then again someday and i am not alone in that thought responsibilities just keep piling up day by day and i just wish that there were a break it would be nice to be a rock star someday i feel that if i were up there on stage that i would be so much happier but i know that i probably would feel the same as i do now i need to do something that will get me recognized someday i feel as if i am destined for fame somehow but as it is now i feel like ill end up in a dead end life like most others i know that most say that there are many other things that make life worth living even though they have a job that they hate but i would rather be a bum then have a job that i hated i would feel like i sold myself out in someway transcendence is something that has always interested me mostly the idea that i could transcend life and become something greater than it the way the words come off ones tongue when they say that makes me feel warm i envy authors that have a mastery of language it would be awesome to write something that when people read it they would be overcome with emotions hopefully ill make enough money in my life that i can stop working and spend all my time making music i just wish i had the balls to become a musician and do what i want but if i do i feel like ill be a failure to all those that i have told that i am going to be a doctor and what not its a nice business its just that there is not much recognition in it unless you put your whole life in it and i do not think that i could put my whole life into it since i do not think i would enjoy it 
people laugh at the same things over and over there does not seem to be any di aminishing of reward no matter how long a joke has been around no matter how old the recipient is the same things seem to make people laugh why is that? maybe its because we like hearing the same stories over and over associating them with our memories like star wars nobody today looks at star wars and says man check out those models no strings? how did they do that? or man that hark hamill is a great actor but most of us can remember a time when we would have said that so we just watch it over and over and over again nobody would do that with schindlers list and the fact that schindler is now in star wars just mucks it all up thats why everyone thinks episode one sucks theyre beyond the point where they want to see any more of that the fact is that theyre all fairly crappy especially return of the jedi good god was that awful but people go back and say it was the best because it reminds them of all the other crappy entertainment they were exposed to when they were kids come on care bears was the most blatantly stupid piece of crap ever to grace the airwaves why did we ever like that in the first place? well it was the s nothing else was on how did the end of the s manage to shift the entire culture of the world from pretense of high fashion to pretense of intelligence? suddenly everyone wanted to be knowledgeable about politics and science or at least enough to talk about them which was not at all you barely need to know what the terms mean to debate something i have seen very intelligent high school kids debate for hours on end without even knowing one of the issues they bring in stuff that makes no sense to the argument like the bible what the heck does isaih have to do with campaign finance reform? all the people in the bible li haved under a sovereign government they didnt even have elections there werent even ideas at the time to compare to these because the closest thing to democracy at the time was the roman government and we all know that the idea of reform was ludicrous to everyone but the people who got ripped off by the government since most of them got ripped off by being murdered its not like they can very well put forth a campaign the romans had a much cleaner system of getting rid of people they didnt like the only liability was that you had a fairly good chance of being knocked off by someone long before you reached the ripe old age of might as well have been anarchy but then again you need some semblance of order to keep people from panicking and having the whole thing fall apart of course we know how well that strategy worked considering the glory of the current roman empire 
i am feeling sad but feeling so much better yesterday was hopeless today there is hope i am realizing that i am so much more complete without my boyfriend than i was with hi am next time i will not let someone control my thoughts and actions so completely next time i will not let myself make excuses for someone i have learned a lot i feel like i want to kiss hi am so bad to feel his lips on mine to feel his skin on mine i want hi am to hold me all night and tell me everything is all right but in my heart i know it is it is so hard to be his friend but i want to so much he says he does not want to lose me it is funny we see each other more often now that we are just friends and no that is not friends with benefits there is no way i would let hi am take advantage of me like that but it would be so much fun then it would hurt so much its really not hard to be with hi am i love being with hi am the hard part is leaving hi am every time i do i feel like i may never see hi am again he hugs me and says it will be ok babe i promise i know he is right it will i just wish it was going to be like i thought it was going to be i had such big plans for this fall after waiting on hi am all summer who could blame me? he seemed so perfect for me last may what happened? i need to stop asking myself these questions and move on with my life i know that but being his friend and seeing hi am all the time is going to make that more difficult i am just trying to be as sweet as possible and show that there are no hard feelings i really am not mad at hi am i just wish i could change the way he felt alright that is not really true the truth is i wish he was a different person i wish he was the person i i amagined he was and truly believed he was all summer instead i fell in love with a commitment-phobic guy who drinks to much and actually owns a rifle i cant believe i could be so stupid he looks so sweet and innocent i am moving on though or i will be shortly i just need to dwell for a little longer like i said there is hope today i know i am beautiful and intelligent and witty and sweet i do not need hi am to tell me that i just wish i had someone who would i am trying so hard to be independent but i have never really had a significant other i could depend on so i guess its not that hard i guess i am just in love with the idea of being in love i want to be swept off my feet i just hope i am not infected with that crazy disease where i can only love people who do not love me back because i want to make people love me i really hope i do not push people away i try so hard to be a good girlfriend but when someone does not call you when he says hes going to and leaves you hanging a million times what are you supposed to do besides get upset and threaten to break up with them? i definitely put up with his shit for way too long i know he will be a better friend than a boyfriend it will just be so hard if i have to see hi am or hear about hi am with someone else especially if that someone else happens to be his ex-girlfriend she tried to get back together with hi am this summer when i was hours away what a bitch i cant believe she would do that i hope he is not still in love with her oh well there is nothing i could do about that anyway didnt i say there was hope today? well there is for the first time in days i actually felt hungry it felt so good to eat and not feel like i was going to throw up it also felt good to not burst into tears every fi have minutes yeah there were a few times when i would have liked to but i think i did alright today after all it has been only a little over hours since he made his decision i am doing very well i think i think it is helping that he wants to be my friend when i told hi am i didnt know because it would be hard he begged me saying  please try i do not want to lose you  i am glad he did that because i do not want to lose hi am either even if he is all wrong for me at least he can be there as a friend for me he says he might want a relationship with me eventually but i do not want to wait for hi am i cant it would end up making me more miserable than ever i think i am better off just going on with my life and talking to hi am only as a friend i think the more i see hi am the more i will realize how wrong he is for me i need someone who will put me before his buddies and who will love me with everything he has i need someone who is ready to make a committment to me i need someone who will send me flowers just because he is thinking about me i need a fairytale romance i need to be swept off my feet i need love real love crazy love like all the songs all the cliches that is what i want more than anything and i do not even know if i believe it exists i want to but cmon folks lets be realistic somehow my parents still manage to love each other but there is not really much passion there at least that i am aware of maybe there is but i doubt it if true love is more than just a friendship that means it involves chemistry and passion but that stuff fades it always fades so what is to separate a strong passionate friendship with true love? fucked if i know all i know is things are really looking up for me now i am going to be just fine 
i have never really thought about what i am thinking before there seems to be someone in the net room making alot of racket thats ok though because this is a dorm they are talking now wait i cant here them anymore wait they just started talking again i wonder what they are talkig about probably something uni amportant i really need to find out where the fine arts library is so i can do this gay reading list i do not even have a clear understanding of what i am supposed to do i assume i just have to look at some art and write down my feelings about it or something it is really annoying becuase the class is already hours long there should not be any outside work but i guess its not too hard and if there are not any set boundaries there is not any set grading material this means that it is basically completion much like this assignment i really want to go to the texas ski ranch tommorrow but i cant find anyone to go and it is like an hour away and it will probably take longer because of traffic because the only time i could leave would be around i hope they have put up some pi amp sliders and kickers out there if anyone reads this and you wakeboard/wakeskate and you want to go ride behind a pi amp ass supra launch ssv and your willing to pay gas money contact me because i am always looking for other riders and other people to pay gas money except myself my roomate is sleeping right now i cant decide if i like hi am or not i do not dislike hi am but i cant i amagine myself being a really good friend of his it seem our only link is that we are roomates he seem like a little bit of a jesus freak and a dork that would suck if he was reading this right now its ok hes not but you know how some people you just feel that you have a connection with them that you can talk to them you know that when your aroud them you feel comfortable you can never tell that when you just look at a person it seems to be the strangest people that are these people that you seem to share a special bond with that you feel completly comfortable with you feel you can be yourself act stupid laugh you become a different person when you are around those people i only noticed that fact this year this year has been a real year of self examination and growth for me i do not think i have grown as much as a thinking human being in this year then any other i do not know what spurred it but i think i know i know i know it was a girl i just got to know this year but when i realized how i amportant she was to me and how much i liked her she was taken in my self pity i couldnt find the strength to tell her how i felt i think i was scared of losing the friendship we already had i didnt want our relationship to be strained by the possibility of me having feelings for her but the feelings not being mutual i should have just told her and gotten it out in the open she changed my life i got the idea in my mind that to be with her i would need to be in the same physical shape as her to have any chance of a relatinship she was the first motivation ever that pushed me to fulfill a long time goal of losing wieght and getting in shape i still think about her and i know in my heart i will pursue her the next oppurtunity the weight loss brings to mind another point that i have noticed about people for as much talk that there is about inner beauty and all that shit its bullshit general bulshi   
this is the first writting assingment i do not realy know what i am soposed to write about i am also afraid that i will mispell a lot of words i was talking with a friend on the way to class today and we started to talk about this assingment it made me kind of nervouse but i guess he survi haved so i will too i cant beli have that only two minutes have passed i guess that is why it takes so long to write all my papers and why they are so short some times i write a stream of consciousness down on paper i think it is a good way to get my mind clear if you write it all on paper you can forget it all for a while then after you have rested with it all off your shoulders you can read thoguh it and see if any of it was something i amportant that you need to look into or if not ohh well at least you no longer are thinking about it i feel like  i should be talking about something more i amportant but i do not have anything i amportant to talk about my friend the guy i mentioned earler he said that he made sure that he was in a bad/wierd mood befoer he started writing so that way he would have a lot to write about i think that was probably a good idea i kind of wish i did that i feel like i am running out of things to say so i guess that i will talk about what i see hear smell well i am in my room i see the wall in fromt of me i hear the computer game my room-mate is playing he always plays a computer game always but he is a real good guy the computer game he is playing is some shoot umup game you run around with a gun ald kill people sleep with one eye open you say right? no its cool well i hear all the guns and what not and in the back ground i guess because he can multi-task i hear music he plays music movies and this game all at the same time min i do not like the song that just came on what i see i see pictures on my wall one is with my friend laurie we were at camp in north carolina we were in her cabin before the campers came she had these two toy firefighters helmets in her cabin that light up and have a siren when you push the button so we were running around camp with them on our heads it was kind of fun i have know laurie for a long time we grew up togther we went to camp togther and youth group conventions she is realy up beat and friendly camp is a great place i went there when i was a kid and now i have been staff the past three summers it is real wierd to see these kids come back evry summer and be a year older they are so different they were adorable or obnoxiouse and now they change or are still the exact same way you remember when the dident have braces and now they are getting them off i remember when i had breaces i hated them but i only had them for one year i had friends who had them for a long time four more mineuts i realy cant spell and i wish i could i am at a loss again my desk is made out of wood but it is not real wood it is composit it is a good desk it does waht it need to my phone just rang my room-mate just picked it up becaise i am on the computer with you it is my friend lyndia she was calling me back i called her before i started writing we were soposed to go to the gym but i think she is there now ohh well so maby abeer jon and i will got down to th 
i was a little nervous about writing for this assignment because i have never really done anything like this so i decided to put it off until the last minute it is now twelve twenty-three on the night before its due i am really beginning to get nervous about the whole college experience so far i havent really met any new people that i would actually fraternize with on a regular basis i think the main reason for this is that so many of my friends from high school are attending ut it is a lot easier to just hang out with them all the time than to bother with the trouble of making new friends although i know in the long run this will not accomplish one of my goals in coming to college which is to make new di haverse and long lasting friendships i do not know i guess will just have to see how things turn out one thing that i am really happy about is the fact that my girlfriend also goes to college here in fact she is a mere stones throw away in lld she means alot to me and during this time of insecurity it makes things a little easier i mentioned lld well that is a girls dorm near llb which is my dorm whitis court that i now call home whitis is a nice little community although i do not much enjoy some of the company here the rooms are nice and very spacious unlike in jester however its still kind of hard to think of this room as my own it seems like a room in a hospital or some mental institution with its industrial white painted walls and linoleum floor i guess its just one more thing ill have to get used to not only is the new college experience making me uncomfortable right now i am also planning on joining the marine corps and going to the plc course this summer it is a big step in my life and i am a little unsure about it right now my father was a marine and his father was in the army and i feel somewhat obligated to serve my country one thing that i would like to accomplish in my life is making my father proud and i think that is perhaps one thing that could me and my father didnt have the greatest relationship this past summer before i went off to college it seemed like he was pushing me away and out of the family i know he loves me but i guess thats just the fathers way of letting go hopefully this time apart will do our relationship well he came into town for a job interview the other day but i didnt get to see hi am it was a little upsetting i really do love and care for my family but i believe they think much to the contrary i guess i do not show it very well or gi have them much common courtesy this short time away from home has made me realize how much they do for me and how much i miss them 
i wonder what this stuff is suposed to mean what can i possibly learn about my self by writing incohearant thoughts for twenty minutes i am not a very good typist for one none too good at spelling either i hope who ever or what ever machine looks at this can read past any spelling and punctuation mistakes this computer screne is far too birght i wish i had thought to fix that before i started this i wish i could read some other students writtings maybe id find some insight to how i am doing in this rat race maybe id figure out what the girls around here are looking for how vacant can my mind be? how many mental diseased is this going to uncover in me? i hope there are drugs to fix it i wish i were at the lake right now no books no tv no phone just a hamock and a cold drink maybe a seadoo a little bit of water sports never hurt anyone accept the ones that crash god i hope never see anything like that again why did that have to happen all those kids had to do was go a little bit slower all they had to do was look around for boats they could have avoided it and now they are dead just beacause they couldnt understand that a jet ski is not a toy a goddamn toy how could anyone  play  with their life like that i hope i go in my sleep i can feel the propeller slicing through my leg right now those poor bastards i guess id rather be one of those kids than the poor bastard that hit them though i could never li have with that kind of baggage they didnt even know where their parents were for the love of god what could they possibly have thought when they got that phone call  mrs smith your daughters are dead there was nothing we could do i guess these things just happen  and how could the parents not blame the draver of that boat?? how coul anyone ever admit that their childs death was their childs own fault? that all seem a bit bleek maybe i am ill maybe i should get a bike i could get around alot faster maybe i should just leave early then maybe i could loose some weight mayeb i have got it all wrong though maybe they do not even care about that i should loose some weight anyway its unhealthy who ever reads this thinks i am a nutcase hello out there welcome to the inner sanctom of my mind its cold in here but youll get used to it watch your step there are some loose screws here and there do not poke at that i am affraid it might fall apart do not trip on that its allready fallen apart i know its messy in here but ill get it all organized sooner or later  i need to hire an inner sanctum of the mind cleaning lady i hear they are very affordable i guess cheap labor is just a byproduct of his whole i ammigration mess maybe that mess has to do with our economic mess or our terrorism mess or our youth mess or our drug mess who in hell is going to clean up any of these messes? can you do one at a time? or are they all linked together? certainly some are ill just let trusty george w handle it err i amean cheany 
wow i have no idea what i am supposed to be doing for this assignment i knew about a book that i was supposed to read in english class last year that was supposedly written in stream of consciousness but since i never read it i have no idea what it was about instead i read cri ame and punishment that was probably the most depressing book i have ever read right now i am reading a tom clancy novel which is much more exciting i cant wait to go back to dallas this weekend to see my family and girlfriend they are all so excited plus i get to see my grandma and actually get some real food man the food here sucks sure theres variety but half the time they do not even have something green out there i mean how the hell are we not supposed to get that freshmen if they arent even giving us some friggin green beans my allergies are killing me i think i almost died last nite i was coughing so much and i am sure i kept my roommate up but i do not really care he shafted me he was going to gi have me a ride to dallas this weekend but instead he made his girlfriend come down so now he wont take me he could have just seen her down there but he didnt want to have to be around adult supervision for that long oh well ill get hi am back hehehe yeah so my arms are definitely starting to get tired i definitely havent done this much typing since fourth grade with mr colonna that was the year that i was introduced and subsequently failed fractions damn i hate fractions with mrs hatch evil lady there is so much reading that i have to do for my classes but so far i am really liking them i took fi have pages of notes today in my architecture class but at the end i was ready to take more we were talking about hitler and the nazis but mainly about the architect that hitler hired to build his sets for his speeches and the headquarters of the nazi party i am now listening to pink floyd and i feel as though i am on a space ship this is some crazy stuff i use this cd to put me to sleep every nite and usually by the second song i am asleep it is so cold in this room i am having to crap somebodys knocking on the door ok i am back now where was i ah yes my toes probably have frost bite now i could get up and turn up the thermostat but then i start sweating profusely and thats definitely no good its been very hard for me to meet people in my dorm so far i am in the new dorm san jacinto and its like a hotel since everyone has their own bathrooms no one really has a chance to mingle because theyre always going somewhere everyone seems like theyre on a mission and theyll kill you if you get in their way i am not exactly the most outgoing guy in the world so let me tell you its more than inti amidating i had such a close great group of friends in high school that i could tell anything to and they felt the exact same way now i have no one to talk to except a few of my friends that came here the problem with that is i just know too many people here so theres always someone to hang out with we just do not get new people to hang out with and its also kind of pointless if you sit down and think about it because the odds are if you see someone somewhere and introduce yourself to them you very well may never even see them again i mean how much does that suck ooh this is my favorite part of the song shine on you crazy diamonds wow that just made me think of band banquet from last year and i have absolutely no idea why unless its because my date was wearing a gold sequine dress and was definitely shining yeah thats prolly it oh lord my hands are tired i am so out of shape i have definitely lost like pounds of muscle over the summer and now everyone here is huge i was big back in high school but comparati havely i am a stinkin shri amp and i really do not have any particular skill at any sport i played soccer in high school but i played goalie and i hate it now i am average at any sport but i do not really excel at anything in particular so i am at a decided disadvantage 
ok i do not like to write but i guess this is not really writing there is a hair stuck between the keys ans i cant get it out it is bothering me why are my dogs barking? maybe my sister is home from school i do not know what to write my nose itches i am hungary i want to go to chillis but i do not kow if i can i am so bad at typing man i wish that i had my computer i cant belei have that no one was here when it came i better get it by this weekend ok i guess my sister is not here then why were my dogs barking? when is she going to be home? she should be here by now? what time is it? ya she should be here joshs sister is home allready is thst how you spell allready? or do you spell it  already  with one l? ah it hasnt even been minutes left i think that i burnt my tongue on that kolache it wa sgood though i want that other piece of it i miss my little kids from la petite i wander if i should get a job there on just fridays but i do not know if i will have time to work and get all of my studying done probibly not because i am already a little behind on my reading i hate chemistry i really dread going to that class i do not understan it at all its like the profesor just skips over the basics how am i suposed to remember all that crap from sophmore year in high school i should have goe to that help session thing well it would have helped if i knew where it was i wander what josh is doing hopefully he is done with his interview and is on his way here well i know he is not because he would have called me did he take tish out to taylor with hi am? bla bla bla where is kristen? i am getting worried i should call mom maybe she stayed for tutorials or she missed the bus i hope she is ok i need to call my mom i really want shri amp pasta stuff that would be really good i need to read i have so much reading to do for biology i do not want to take amber to her school what a pain in the but i am never going to be able to finish reading tonight i do not have time 
my roommate is gone once again to class i believe hes a strange sucker it  really befuddles me how he denies having whey protein and instantly changes the  subject i wish my hands werent so swollen it might make this easier speaking  of psycology the professors lecture today was interesting to say the least  especially finding out that scientists sit around shocking rats to make the ejaculate  and pass out very strange also strange is how someone whom i thought was  one of my most hated enemies or deemed me as such is sitting next to me in that  class and how the girl that sat next to me comes off as much more a  city  person  than she really is my floor is really strange they all just sneak around the first week i only saw one  other person that li haved up here other than my roommate who is strange hi amself as  previously noted i feel compelled to change my major to pys so i can deconstruct  hi am and make hi am paranoid of the world mostly cause of the whey protein  incident grrr and he plays video games non fucking stop its driving me insane  and hes s junior i t hought he was s freshman the way his mother was helping  move hi am in and such my folks didnt even help me pack back at home they said see ya next weekend were coming down for the game  i do not want to do my economics homework so i am doing this instead as a more  viable excuse than just sitting in front of the computer chatting and checking the  weather leastwise i am getting something done cause i wont be here thursday or  friday on account of me going to a horse show in springfield ill where ill be  competing for national championships and as i think in contention for both so it  could potentially be a very good weekend i am also excited about seeing some  girl friends i havent seen in a yr and i am hoping they are equally excited but well  see and i hope our trainer does not mess the horse up before i show considering  ill have zero practice because i show right after i fly in  speaking of flying i hope that planes will be in the air and a si amilar thing to last  year wont happen we had to dri have hours as opposed to flying since all flights  were cancelled for an indetermined amount of time and the shows bad ti aming of  starting on the th and of course its the same this yr too  i hate it when my brothers girlfriend tries to talk to me and i hate it when people  ask what i am doing if i am on the computer i am on the computer i am not doing  anything elsewise id be out doing it man coke is good the beverage of course  so much better than pepsi and r c and that ripp of stuff you get at supermarkets  that have stupid names i hate pigeons they really bother me  the seem so unclean especially when you are swi ammin in the pool and they are drinking and bathing in  the other side i hate that and those grackels they just look dirty and so annoying but the squirrels are cool i have been tempted many a time to just grab one but i think that wouldnt be wise especially since i do not plan on visiting the health  center any time soon so i refrain but it would be cool especially to see all the out-there ani amal rights and weirdos faces those people  dri have me insane and all the christian rhetoric do not they have something better to  do than harrass me when i am walking early in the morning or if i am carrying  something the bastards set it on top ggrrrrrr very aggrivating and the newspaper  what up with that if we want one well grab it ourselves theyd probably get rid of  more that way because the second you call out to someone they instantly take a  defensi have posture even if it is free its this damn culture of telemarketers and  wackos youre constantly berrated to buy something or not buy something on  grounds that somebody else or something else will benefit without regard to the  purchaser but one day i hope to exploit that just like the other guy because with  the right mind set and marketing ploy people will buy anything you tell them to and  that my friend has been proved over and over again 
coming to ut has been a pretty crazy experience my first week here i already felt like i was at home it wasnt that way at the college i attended previously that place took my two years to get comfortable i think it has something to do with the fact that i have grown friendlier to most people the one exception is my roommate drew i do not know why we arent best friends but i think it has a lot to do wiht the fact that we come from two entirely distinct backgrounds he was the son of a cop whos prents got divorced and i was the son of a librarian who parents always talked about getting divorced also here women seem to enjoy my preasance more i think that has a lot to do with my radical overhaul of my diet and exercise routine one girl in particular is named vanessa she is an entirely charming girl with a body to die for but i do not know how do we trully know we found the right one is it that divine spark that fills our soul thew first time we lay eyes on a person or is it a familiarity that stems from shared time with someone that eventually turns to amore? unfortunantly i was cursed with finding love at frist sight with my fist girl friend but being as young as we were i cnat help but think what would hve happened if we would have met later on this subject i have often wondered about my parents i have a vague notion that theirs was a marraige of convience i overheard one day that the last time they had sex was the night i was concieved???? i do not now what that means just came up this i think is the point of life the wondering lust filled age we are in now followed by silent i ampotent contemplation no wonder why all people in power are old and white they do not have the dri have in their hearts to find romantic ideals the way youth does in a sense i think i am an idealist i like to see the glass as half full but usually only with people i care about this deals alot with social conciense what a terrible thing to have all of us who are educated are confronted evertday with the absurdities of our goals i want to have a nice house and car for my family and i want to help the world but would i accept lesser for those i love to compensate those i do not know??? off course not yet high minded individuals lambast me when they are doing the exact smae thing so in the end what does one do pursue their own intersts or bang ones head against the system i think it has to be a mixure of the two because the more one knows the more one knows that nothing in this world is blakc and white tragis heroes are made from this assumption we see how they are commended for making the right choice and getting awarded for it but seldom do we see all the others who struggle to make the moraly right choice and are punished incesantly growing up poor i saw this all around me many of the poeple i know cannot afford to make the right descision i myself have chosen to get a college eduction rather than have medical insurance really in the last years i have done a lot rather than have medical insurance namely eating having clothes and living life all this ties into the idea that there are not racial barriers anymore but class barriers that are divided by check books thats not to sya that the overwhelming majority of poor are not minority but only looking at color does not diagnose the true problem money 
i am really tired i got up this morning at to go get tickets for the seniors in my fraternity and i do not even know if ill get to go theyre for the texas vs ou game in october i was up last night until and i had to wake up at this morning to go wait in line at the stadium i have the song  nashville blues  by cory morrow in my head because last night after walking rachel back to her room i came in to find three half-naked drunken frat boys had wandered into my room and awoken my roommate they were making hi am play  nashville blues  while they sung and taped the entire episode they clai amed to be filming  towers gone wild  which was a take-off of  girls gone wild  only filmed at towers i have recently been seeing a cute girl but i am sort-of afraid of commitment twenty minutes seems to me like a long time to type i have barely made it through six minutes and i am pretty much ready to go to bed and stop doing this this girl is really cute and sweet but i just got over a really hard break-up and i am kind-of anxious about getting into a new relationship where the same thing could happen i think that it is funny that although i am supposed to be writing in stream-of-consciousness my spelling and grammar are almost i ampeccable i wonder if the person who reads this will agree i probaby made a typo on some really easy word and therefore the grader will assume that i am a pompous idiot that is too conceited to see my own faults or maybe thats me talking maybe i am  grading  myself when i say something like that nine minutes and forty three seconds its funny that by the time i had written  nine minutes and forty three seconds  that time had passed i am now very ready to stop this assignment twenty minutes is not an absurd amount of time for the professor to ask for but it does seem like a long time to write without stopping i wonder what tank is doing i wonder if laurie is going to come over to  see  hi am i do not like laurie very much i think shes very annoying she whines far too much now i am whining about her i hope i am not keeping my roommate up with my typing this keyboard is pretty loud i still have to write for another seven minutes my neck itches there thats better my composition has gotten much less formal and much more personal since i mentioned the perfection of my spelling and grammar tank just walked in and totally interruptd my train of thought he does not really respect peoples space too much but hes an overall pretty good guy if i go to sleep in fifteen minutes i can take a three and a half hour nap before i have to be at the house to build i am not going to philosophy i am too tired i do not really think ill be missing too much because if i did go i would fall asleep in there as well my bed is much more comfortable than those tables in the law building that is a really long walk i takes thirty minutes my back hurts i need a shower i need a cup of iced tea i actually do not need either of those i just want a shower and a cup of iced tea and a nap i am a pretty funny guy if i put my mind to it right now i am not putting my mind to anything but sleep english was boring today just like every other day i think i probably failed that reading quiz i probably got a fifty i read about fifty percent of the selection my professor must be pretty good at making quizzes if theyre that accurate i never had that happen in high school i am just going to stop now good night 
i know i should probably find this sort of assignment intriguing but really i am just bored as hell i think i can honestly say that i never i imagined myself doing something like this i guess its something i always i amagined only druggies and insomniacs did then again i consider myself an insomniac but like i said here we are my only motivation for doing this is that my roommate has promised me that after i finish my writing assignment we can go to lunch how sad she is like my mom she wakes me up in the mornings when i oversleep she keeps track of my assignments for the classes we have together she cleans the room and even sadder food is my only motivation meh in other news the ut body project is going well i got paid for the seminar i attended yesterday they want us to diet for the next week though they stress that its not diet[ing] but more finding a homeostasis in the course of our daily consumptions somehow i do not see that happening on a lighter note my new computer is totally freaking super awesome its great having a computer that does not restart every day and actually has enough memory to complete whole tasks my poor baby i am not too sure what to do with my old computer so for now its sitting in a dell box in the middle of my room taking up space so its hard for me to access my closet but oh well who needs clothes anyway my roommate is sick right now asking for tissues this could be a disaster she is also trying to read what i am writing clai aming that i am talking trash about her everything she is heard is true and because i am confident in the fact that no one is going to read this and on the off chance that they do they wont gi have a shit ill delve a little bit into my personal life i wrote an e-mail to s as well call hi am for now while he was gone though he wasnt technically gone he went to harvard for college and his computer had not yet arri haved speaking of which because harvard is gay their holiday breaks are all messed up so they just started school and while we get out of school on the th of may they do not get out till the th i think it suxrz fortunately i asked arjun and their spring break does not coincide with ours which means my roommate angela and i might go visit them up in boston during our spring break if theres enough money and if we care but i digress then again i guess the point of this is to digress so by not digressing i actually am digressing ok i am not going to confuse myself further anyway back to the e-mail right so i wrote it and he got back on tuesday as he said he would but by the id already gotten my new computer and installed it and everything unfortunately i do not have the proper network cable to network my computers just yet so its still on my old pos computer oh well it wasnt anything i amportant just a stream-of-consciousness type thing a lot like this except a lot longer i forget what the point of this story was oh well i guess what i am trying to say is that a the donnie darko soundtrack is very good and b i miss hi am a lot a lot a lot he is going to have fun up at harvard with his friends while i am stuck down here with no ability to make friends whatsoever its so depressing i do not really like it down here i miss saikat and arjun and amit bah i really need to update my journal sometime soon i think oftentimes i make such an effort to make the entries i write so pensi have and thought-provoking that if i am ever experiencing writers block or whatever i just wont update what a shame i need to stop caring about how i write and start worrying about what i write people do not need to read something well-written to be able to enjoy it then again whats to convince myself that my entries are interesting anyway oh poo in other news the movie the good girl is really good it helped me to explore some aspects of my life that id never gi haven much thought to i guess i should have 
right now i am feeling tired and a little burnt out i have had a quiz and a test this week so i have been stressed out i havent taken my chemistry test yet so i am nervous about that i have studied but i do not feel prepared its cold in our dorm room right now its cloudy outside which is how i feel about certain aspects in life i am not sure i will accomplish my goals in life though i know that if i gi have it my best effort that there is nothing more i could have done no one is in the room other than me so i am feeling a little lonely not too much though sometimes it is nice to be alone i have always enjoyed being alone everynow and then i feel like i need to relax i didnt get tickets to the game this saturday so i am pissed about that i did get tickets to the ou game though so that made me happy i like to listen to music it also helps me to relax i am listening to music right now as a matter of fact i have a heavy course load though not too bad i know that if i quit that ill regret it for the rest of my life i think regret is probably one of the worst feelings in the world next to loneliness loneliness you could almost always fix but regret is much harder to deal with time is going by too slowly i think i am running out of stuff to talk about it does feel good to get your feelings out and onto something like paper sometimes i think it would be better to write out all your feelings on paper so that someone wouldnt have to sit there and listen to you bitch about your life all the time but other times thats exactly what you need my favorite tv show is scrubs the main character portrays me down to a t watching scrubs is another way i relax i am not necessarily worried about my chemistry test or at least not to the point of where i am dreading going i know that all i can do is my best i know i have talked about this but i love music i can feel it in my soul when it plays i can feel the song i can feel the notes the rhythms all of it i can close my eyes and just get lost in a song its weird i know my time is almost up i am hungry it seems like now that i am thinking about how hungry i am that it is taking longer to finish than it did before i am writing this at a m thats not necessarily early in my book but it is definitely too early to do this i have a lot of reading to do i am happy to be at ut its what i have wanted to do all my life i want to be a doctor a heart surgeon actually it seems like its going to be tough which is no surprise i need to buckle down more next week it starts what is it you ask? it is me buckling down and going hardcore on my classes minutes left this was easier than i thought it would be minute left i almost forgot to write this that would have sucked and i would have been pissed but i remembered so i happy i feel better writing down all this 
i hope i can make it to my next class on time the pop up ads on my computer are getting very annoying my throat hurts i have to take a pill i got from health services a little cold in here it just got a lot darker i have to turn in a maintenance slip so theyll change my light bulbs meningococcal vaccine today after chemistry i shouldnt crack my knuckles i wonder how my roommate can study so much what does he have so much work in? i miss andi she is in new york right now with football players and lacrosse players all over her it makes me angry i hate being jealous but i cant help it no one else is online i hope andi will visit soon i bet ill go into a trance if i stare at this screen long enough i wont fall asleep ill just kind of zone out it got darker again why do not i notice when it gets light? i have to call leslie from a chi o and make sure she brings all the girls to our mixer tonight i have to get to the gym out of shape only minutes? wow id better think more i feel like a monk i must block outside distractions and focus my energy inside darker again there are monks in tibet that can raise their body temperature by ten degrees or so just by meditating the power of the mind i have beach boys stuck in my head for some reason now god thats irritating why is my back so stiff? i need to get more sleep mondays and wednesdays suck because i have to get up early no tv and no beer make homer something something the si ampsons is a great show its slacked a little recently but its still good there it got brighter but slowly i am cold i havent had a single test yet i wonder how hard they will be economics is so boring stream of consciousness i should shave now no time i cant shave for two months damn fraternity how can i type continuously if i am not thinking anything? i think too much usually but now nothing i overanalyze things or at least thats what my ex girlfriend told me i think that i was just thorough oh well its just like paranoia is just a heightened sense of awareness that was in a movie conspiracy theory with mel gibson i never saw it mel gibson was on the si ampsons once apparently his family is very anti-semitic i wonder what andi is doing hey does not the average guy in america think about sex once every seconds or something? every other line i should write sex  or just something gross and raunchy oh well sex ha i think girls are worse than guys but no one knows it i think if we put a microphone in a guys room and in a girls room youd be blown away buy what the girls say crazy sex i hope i can see andi soon she is busy with tennis i want her to come ok i am done sex haha

my computer is spiffy i decided to name it mara which means bitterness apparently but i was naming it after a character in the star wars books who is really cool my computer gets in fights with a friends computer we type to each other over aol instant messenger about what are computers are supposedly doing to each other she named her computer screwtape after a demonic character c s lewis developed its hard to write stream of consciousness things because my brain works much faster than my fingers and by the time my fingers catch up i am on to a new thought i am also kind of a perfectionist in my typing because i hate to spell things wrong and make grammatical mistakes however i probably wont be able to keep myself from making such mistakes because i am typing so fast one of my friends is i aming me but i cant respond because i have to do this for an entire minutes i am only at minutes seconds right now i guess i can keep hi am waiting he is one of the best friends you could ever have however i am having a little trouble right now because he and i are slightly attracted to each other and he and my best girl friend just broke up and i know she still adores hi am completely besides i think theyre much better for each other than he and i could be he and i are both too proud and arrogant she is proud but she does not think she knows everything she is pretty zany i met her back in the th grade and weve been friends ever since our friendship has had its ups and downs but it has never halted i just couldnt hook up with her ex-boyfriend because that would be tacky at least for the next couple years i know she had be really upset and i could never forget the way they were together fortunately i think the boy is on somewhat of the same wavelength as me speaking of romantic interests theres a boy who li haves next door to me whos pretty attracti have however i think a lot of girls are attracted to hi am so i would have a lot of competition and i do not like competition he seems like a really nice guy though i am thinking right now he is somewhat of an idiot one of my suitemates was hosting a drinking party and apparently he came i was locked away in my room attempting to study because i have a quiz and a test tomorrow actually later today since it is now after midnight i wish i could find a guy who wasnt so emotionally messed up or low in the self-esteem department that he feels he has to drink his cares away speaking of which chris hasnt e-mailed me back he and i got into an argument and he avoids too much confrontation though he has a tendency to inadvertently start it and keep it going so anyways right now he is avoiding me i wish he would talk to me because he is one of the few people i trust to be honest moral and to steer me from harm and i need to talk to a guy like that right now i seem to attract guys who arent particularly moral and who tend to be too apathetic to care about making themselves better people the irony is they like me they tell me because i am so moral pure and sweet someones knocking at the door it took only seconds to answer it my roommate just returned from finishing a computer science assignment in the computer lab she is really cool probably one of the best possible roommates i could have she is quite eclectic she likes to knit particularly when she is listening to lectures because it keeps her hands busy if i have enough energy i fidget during lectures i used to play with a hacky sack in high school some of my teachers would actually play catch with me with it it was cool because my teachers trusted me i even was friends with a few i went to lunch with a few of them about a month ago i am going to miss them speaking of which i need to e-mail mr karnavas my former bible/philosophy/greek teacher 
right now i am thinking about the point of this i guess maybe it does have some point but i really do not see one but anyhow its not that bad of an assignment i mean just typing what you are thinking for twenty minutes my dorm room is rather hot and i want to get up to turn our fan on but i wont because then i would have to leave the computer and then i couldnt track my thoughts for those few second that i leave the computer i waiting for a phone call from my boyfriend he was supposed to call around but he has not called yet and its starting to irritate me i also notice that i have only been typing for like minutes i wonder what i am going to be typing for more minutes gosh i have some much to do tonight i have to starch my army uniform and polish my boots and i have to finish retyping my rhetorical analysis paper that didnt get saved for some reason and then i have to do some biology reading and finsih some biology questions i do not really like my biology class but i do like my chemistry class but that probably just because its easy and i have done well in it so far my ear is starting to hurt i hope i do not have an ear infection i feel like i am starting to get a headache maybe its because i am tired or maybe because i am hungry or maybe because i am dehydrated i dunno but once this is over i think i am going to take some advil and hopefully that will make it feel better this is hard forcing myself to write what i am thinking of i have been looking at a computer screen most of the day and my eyes are starting to hurt maybe that is why i have a headache who knows but i cant wait till i get to go to sleep so do you guys actually read these i bet these can get really interesting i mean if i had to read over of these id probably be pretty bored but maybe pysch guys just like reading random thoughts hundreds of them is it sti amulating? i am dating a guy who a psych major he is in grad school right now mastering in something pysch related he is supposed to call me right now maybe he got held up reading random stream of conscious stuff my jaw is aching right now too i have tmj and it sucks my jaw is out of alignment and it hurts really bad i wish i could just pop it back in place but that would be all sorts of hard and probably fairly painful but anyways and its only been like minutes this is crazy after this i have to do some real writing that does not rock my world because i know that ill be tired and i wont feel like doing it an then ill tell myself that ill sleep for like an hour and then wake up and finish what i need to do but it wont happen gosh i am so freaking tired and my ears are really starting to hurt but i think it might be from my jaw and that probably why i have a headache gosh i really could go for a massage right about now but i do not want to spend any of my money my boyfriend gi haves really good massages and he is supposed to call me but he has not called me yet what a dick ugh how much longer of this seriously twenty minutes i doubt that this writing assignment aside from a si ample grade really benefits me in anyway so is this an assignment so you psych guys can have experi aments and such? crazy so we pay money to take a class so we can do assignments for psych guys who use them as experi aments hmmm i do not know if i like that idea but oh well because this assignment is a lot better than the next one that i will have to do but this is making me so tired and my eyes are really starting to have a hard time focusing on the computer and then when i close them i want to keep them shut and just sleep for like a few seconds and then a few seconds more oh well i only have like a minute left count down  ah nice its over 
okay this is weird i do not like assignments like this one i am trying to track my own thoughts and feelings trying to be somewhat original and all i find is nothing really seems like deep down i am pretty reserved well actually i know that i am so this is not a surprising anyways there it is nothing rachel just got home she is my sister she had swi am team practice i think she has more talent than she is willing to admit she has does that make sense? working hard is not her most favorite thing though i bet you wondering why i am expressing myself so badly it has to do with the fact that english is not my nati have language i am german my real family is still in germany so rachel is not my real sister she is part of the family i am staying with now i am going blank again lets talk about the family i am staying with then they are very kind after all they arent charging me anything why? thats a longer story i think my host mom would be an interesting case for psychology there is not anything wrong with her its just an perfect example for insecurity at its highest level the funny thing is that nobody would ever suspect this insecurity and i am sure she would vehemently repudiate such a statement but its true from what i understand you can blame that on her childhood her version is that her parents wanted a boy as their first child well it was her they got accordingly her parents made that very clear throughout her whole life well you can deri have your own i amplications anyways she is on a constant mission to prove to everybody how smart and special she is it goes even so far that she fabricates facts in order to win arguments even when you present her with indisputable facts she refuses to admit that she was wrong she goes as far as questioning well known axioms or pundits anyway i should be talking about myself i have my own problems i cant state my feelings that is as far as i will go because i cant talk about it then it cant be cured irony now i am thinking about ut its pretty overwhelming in germany my high school graduating class had about people yup but i will do fine i am just having these high expectations in college i want to find my dead poet society - teacher someone that will point me in the right direction that makes learning an adventure right now i still have to force myself to do homework time is up  
psikolog selalu berusaha untuk memahami bagaimana pikiran bekerja dan bagaimana hal itu tidak bekerja dalam beberapa kasus dapat hal-hal seperti dipahami atau kita hanya menipu diri kita sendiri bahwa pengetahuan apapun dapat dicapai saya kira saya selalu menemukan psikologi menjadi bidang yang sangat megah meskipun salah satu yang menarik kita semua ingin mengontrol kaya li kami dan mengantisipasi tindakan dan keinginan orang lain membantu kita mempertahankan bahwa fasad kontrol mungkin saya masuk ke sebuah dunia yang lebih filosofis pada saat ini tapi itu di mana pikiran saya membawa saya adalah kehendak bebas hanya ilusi saya telah memikirkan hal ini banyak sayangnya tidak ada definiti telah jawaban ini atau pertanyaan lain ada tuhan saya tidak pernah mendengar argumen logis suara bagi keberadaan dewa i memungkinkan untuk kemungkinan dewa tapi pasti tidak akan menjadi dewa christian saya pikir pada akhirnya bahwa saya harus setuju dengan eksistensialis tidak ada bukti atau menentang keberadaan tuhan sehingga kita harus berhenti membuang-buang time berspekulasi dan hanya berurusan dengan kehidupan ini beberapa orang dapat berhubungan dengan itu kami takut akan kematian membuat kita buat agama sehingga kita bisa berpura-pura ada beberapa kemiripan kehidupan setelah tubuh duniawi kita mati ini tidak pengalaman baru saya hanya berpikir pada permintaan pikiran saya bergerak paling mudah untuk jalur itu tahu dan saya menyajikan beberapa ide yang lebih koheren sini adalah seseorang benar-benar membaca ini kau mengerti bahwa saya manusia saya bukan obyek i am dalam tubuh tetapi saya tidak tubuh sendiri saya pikiran luas dan kompleks saya perasaan anda unggul karena anda dapat menganalisis pikiran saya meminta anda ini sehingga anda dapat bertanya pada diri sendiri apakah anda menikmati memperlakukan orang sebagai obyek bahkan anda mengakui dalam pikiran sadar anda bahwa anda memperlakukan orang sebagai objek mungkin tidak kemungkinan bahwa saya menjadi sedikit tidak adil untuk anda dan profesi anda masih itu baik untuk mengajukan pertanyaan kita semua hanya sedikit terlalu puas dan mudah dikontrol saya melihat perlunya agama tapi saya pikir banyak dari kita yang di atas bahwa saya tidak perlu membeli moralitas saya dari orang lain apa yang moralis dan filsuf melakukan i menghormati plato untuk logika kierkegaard nya kecuali kant teisme untuk explications nya metafisika dan epistemologi nietzsche kecuali pada akhir hari-harinya lavey kecuali ketergantungannya pada ritual dan psikolog kesombongannya dan ilmuwan perilaku saya tinggal jauh dari yang paling di beberapa titik sakit kembali ke dalamnya tapi saya terlalu dimatikan oleh freud dan asumsi megah yang lain banyak membaca fiksi itu saya akan menyebutkan beberapa lusin penulis tapi kemudian mengapa tunduk diri ke penilaian seseorang saya bahkan tidak bisa melihat musik saya menemukan musik menjadi sangat i amportant anda cant mendapatkan dengan tanpa musik dan anda cant hanya mendengarkan indiscri aminately baik saya pikir pemahaman yang nyata dari catatan dikuasai oleh ritme kord dan instrumentasi diperlukan sebelum seseorang dapat mengatakan apa-apa tentang segala jenis musik yang anda memahami musik bagaimana anda bereaksi terhadap pertanyaan saya anda harus digunakan untuk mengajukan pertanyaan daripada harus orang lain meminta mereka yang anda mendapatkan apa-apa dari ini ini lebih menarik daripada kebanyakan tanggapan terhadap tugas yang sama atau anda bahkan perawatan yang anda beralih ke seorang rekan dan mengatakan hei anak ini benar-benar membuat sia-sia a berusaha untuk memahami kaya moti saya senang dengan pembalikan peran saya dianggap menghasilkan narrati nyata dan bertele-tele memiliki untuk tugas ini tapi kemudian anda mungkin telah mengambil yang sedikit terlalu serius bob kami mendapat gila lagi di sini ah time berlalu dan kegiatan lainnya menunggu selamat tinggal untuk sekarang
